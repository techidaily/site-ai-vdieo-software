<h5 id="Liza-Brown"><a href="#Liza-Brown" class="headerlink" title="Liza Brown"></a>Liza Brown</h5><p> Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions</p>
<p>Suppose you have recorded a cinematic video of a beach in the evening visualizing the sunset and a few birds flying in the sky. Everything looks perfect except the audio, which seems to be fluctuating and breaking at some points. How would you address this challenge?</p>
<p>The best solution to this problem is adding sound effects, which can make your video more interesting and adorable. Setting the frequency of audio with on-screen visuals will invoke the viewers’ emotions and attach them to the scene.</p>
<p>Read this article to learn how to add sound effects to your video with Final Cut Pro.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Ambiance SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Foley SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Hard and Soft SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Electronic SFX</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.</p>

<p>Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.</p>
<p>Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience.

Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.</p>
<p>Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.</p>
<p>Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.</p>

Here are few tips to help you create exciting and entertaining highlight reels.</p>
<p><strong>Learn the event timeline</strong></p>
<p>When you want to create a highlight video for any event, whether official or personal, study the event schedule beforehand. For instance, when filming a wedding, know when the bride will arrive when the couple exchanges rings and vows. If your highlight video is about a conference, it is essential to know when speakers will deliver the speech, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Make a list of shots</strong></p>
<p>Next, have a list of parts that you wish to capture so that you are more organized at the event. You can’t predict each moment but being ready will help you capture memorable moments.</p>
<p><strong>Use the right equipment</strong></p>
<p>You need to use proper equipment for the events to ensure the footage looks great in low light. Gather all your equipment before the event and make sure it is fully charged and functional. Carry the extra batteries and other tools as well.</p>

Here are few tips to help you create exciting and entertaining highlight reels.</p>
<p><strong>Learn the event timeline</strong></p>
<p>When you want to create a highlight video for any event, whether official or personal, study the event schedule beforehand. For instance, when filming a wedding, know when the bride will arrive when the couple exchanges rings and vows. If your highlight video is about a conference, it is essential to know when speakers will deliver the speech, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Make a list of shots</strong></p>
<p>Next, have a list of parts that you wish to capture so that you are more organized at the event. You can’t predict each moment but being ready will help you capture memorable moments.</p>
<p><strong>Use the right equipment</strong></p>
<p>You need to use proper equipment for the events to ensure the footage looks great in low light. Gather all your equipment before the event and make sure it is fully charged and functional. Carry the extra batteries and other tools as well.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason.

<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>

                      alt="file manager app show hidden files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>

                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom.

Contacts can see your current location and if you are online at any given time.</p>
<p>Sending free messages to contacts all over the world is made possible through the usage of WiFi or a network connection using WhatsApp. In WhatsApp, you may set a status, which informs your relatives and friends about your whereabouts and whether or not you are online so that they can view the messages.</p>
<p>WhatsApp Status is a status update that is only visible for 24 hours after it is uploaded. You can send pictures, videos, text, links, and animated GIFs to other people.

WhatsApp Status is activated only between two people, who have each other’s contact information saved in their address books; this happens by default.

Many people use both Instagram and WhatsApp to update their status. It happens that, at times, you might want to save your friends’ statuses as a remembrance or for some other reason. While photos can be screenshotted, videos require the help of the File Manager or any third-party app.</p>
<p>Below are the steps you need to follow for saving WhatsApp status and then sharing it further.</p>
<p><strong>Method 1: Save It with File Manager</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: View the status that you wish to save. This creates a temporary copy on the phone’s storage.</p>
<p>Step 2: Open your <strong>File Manager app</strong>. Click on the hamburger icon (three dots) present on the right corner of the screen.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-app-show-hidden-files.jpg"
                      alt="file manager app show hidden files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: On the next screen of Settings, you can enable the option of show hidden files. Go to the internal storage of the device.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-whatsapp-files.jpg"
                      alt="file manager whatsapp files"
                ></p>
<p> Step 4: Look for the WhatsApp folder, go to ‘Media’ and then click on the folder ‘.Statuses’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/file-manager-whatsapp-statuses.jpg"
                      alt="file manager whatsapp statuses"
                ></p>
<p>Step 5: From here you can copy any file and then save it to another folder to watch or share later on.</p>
<p><strong>Method 2: Save It with Third-Party App</strong></p>
<p>Step 1: First, download the app <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.downlood.sav.whmedia&hl=en_US&gl=US" >‘Status Saver – Downloader for WhatsApp <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.’ And open the app and grant it storage access.</p>
<p>Step 2: In order to save someone’s WhatsApp status, you must first view it in WhatsApp. After watching the status, open the Status Saver app.</p>
<p>Step 3: When you open it, you will see all the statuses you have seen on WhatsApp. Tap on the movie or image you wish to save, then click the download icon at the bottom. The share icon on the right allows you to share the status with WhatsApp contacts, Instagram, Facebook, and other networks.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-FAQs-about-WhatsApp-Status-3"><a href="#Part-5-FAQs-about-WhatsApp-Status-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: FAQs about WhatsApp Status"></a>Part 5: FAQs about WhatsApp Status</h2><p><strong>Who can see my WhatsApp status?</strong></p>
<p>It’s only possible for someone to see your status updates if both of you have each other’s phone numbers in your phone’s address book. You have the option of sharing your status updates with everyone in your contact list or just those you specify. Unless you change this setting, your status updates are visible to everyone on your contact list.</p>
<p><strong>What is the benefit of using WhatsApp status?</strong></p>
<p>The WhatsApp status feature allows the user to share pictures, text, videos, and GIFs on their account. The best part is that these disappear after 24 hours and are end-to-end encrypted. This feature makes it possible for you to stay in touch with people by sharing motivation posts, fun videos, or any memorable moment.</p>
<p><strong>How to Know Who Viewed My WhatsApp Status?</strong></p>
<p>It is very easy to check who has viewed your WhatsApp status. The steps you need to follow are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Open WhatsApp and tap the Status tab;</li>
<li>Then click on ‘My Status,’ and a list of statuses will appear.</li>
<li>Tap on the status that you want to check viewers for, and then look for the ‘eye’ icon.Click the ‘eye’ icon, and a list of viewers will appear.</li>
</ol>
