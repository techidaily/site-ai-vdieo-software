Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>

After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>
<p><img

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png"
                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-1" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>

Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Specifically, a FREEmium text-to-speech converter that you can use when you’re still on the trying-out stage! This part will include a tutorial and a short introduction:</p>
<h3 id="014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2"><a href="#014-Steps-to-Use-and-Convert-Text-to-Speech-Online-Free-Unlimited-2" class="headerlink" title="014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?"></a>014 Steps to Use and Convert Text to Speech Online Free Unlimited?</h3><p>First, for the promised tutorial! Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload or Copy &amp; Paste Text"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set Voice Reader"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Adjust Speech Controls"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

That means that, if you want to make use of all of its advanced features, you’ll need to pay a price!</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Text-to-Speech is an ingenious accessibility invention that has only grown more and more popular as AI has been thrown in the mix — making the converted speech sound more natural than ever!</p>
<p>As requested, in this article, we’ll be focusing on the subject of <strong>converting text to MP3</strong> format (or, rather, a tangible file that you can use for projects!)</p>

Text-to-Speech, also called TTS, as previously mentioned, is an accessibility invention. It was developed to help those with vision impairment or blindness — giving them the ability to have text read to them out loud to them (without requiring someone specifically read it out loud for them.</p>
<p>More recent development in TTS technology has allowed it to grow more useful outside of those parameters, however. Especially seeing as it is now possible to convert <strong>text to MP3 with natural voices</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3"><a href="#01Why-Use-Text-to-Speech-Converter-3" class="headerlink" title="01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?"></a>01Why Use Text to Speech Converter?</h3><p><strong>Text-to-Speech human voice converter</strong>s are popular with content creators, and thus, they are the ones who see the most use for them (in the commercial sense). After all, it’s easy enough to convert already created content (in the form of text) into an audio file that there’s no reason not to! Especially since it means that more people would have access to their content!</p>

Getting a live voice actor to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> for you is very expensive — since you’re paying not only for the voice-actors hours spent but also the use of the expensive equipment that they use for creating voiceovers.</p>
<p>In that regard, even PAID text-to-speech converters are easier on the budget. Making it the perfect solution for content creators who want to increase the accessibility of their content but do not have the time (to create the voiceovers themselves) or the money (to hire someone else to record it).</p>

And, depending on what you’re looking for, you might find yourself longing for extra features later on down the line. That is why, when looking to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> we recommend considering the following:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Converting Time</strong>: How fast does the converter work? Most text-to-speech converters work almost instantaneously! So, if the one you’re using currently is slow? It might be best to give it a pass over to the next candidate.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Sound Quality</strong>: You should also test out whether or not the sound quality of the converted text to speech is good.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Multi-Language Support</strong>: Since this is all for the sake of increasing accessibility, you should start thinking about how many languages your converter supports as well. You might not be able to use all of them or even want to. But, that extra function can be helpful for the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Voice-Control Options</strong>: Does the converter offers you advanced voice controls? Your average converter usually offers speed and voice options, but you might find that a text-to-speech converter with more advanced options (i.e., tone, pitch, etc. controls) may help you get better quality content in the long run.</p>

Most <strong>text-to-human voice converter</strong>s function much the same way. The main difference usually being on the number of features focused and the limitations imposed (for tools with FREEmium services that impose limits on the FREE version, like the tool we’ll be using for our example):</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Upload Text</strong></p>
<p>First, upload the text that you want to convert into speech!</p>
<p>Most online converters offer a text box that you can use in order to copy &amp; paste the text onto (like in the image below), while others offer an ‘upload’ feature that you can use to upload text from a document.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2: Adjust Voice Reader!</strong></p>
<p>Next, the main thing that you usually have to worry about is the voice options.</p>
<p>Most TTS converters at least offer the opportunity to choose what voice you want the text to be read in. Some, more advanced solutions, may offer voices in other languages, dialects, accents, etc. as well as voice control options (tone, pitch, etc.)</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Reader Controls!</strong></p>
<p>Outside of voice options, most text-to-speech converters also offer the ability to control the general outcome of the converted text to speech.</p>
<p>More advanced tools will have multiple options on offer for this, but even the most basic ones at least offer a method for controlling the speed at which the text is read by the voice you’ve chosen!</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4: Convert Text to MP3!</strong></p>
<p>Now is finally the time to <strong>convert text to MP3</strong> format! Some TTS readers will not allow for this without you paying the premium price, but most will at least offer a limited MP3 conversion feature (usually one that limits the length of conversion or the quality).</p>

In this next part, we’ll be focusing on “super tips”</p>
<p>OR, tips that allow you to generally make the most of these <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> to the fullest!</p>
<p><strong>Tip 1: Use AI Text-to-Speech!</strong></p>
<p>Our first tip is to encourage you to take full advantage of AI text-to-speech functions. Artificial Intelligence allows the converted text to sound much nicer and much more like it was read by an actual human being — which enables you to create a very professional-sounding project without having to hire a voiceover actor&#x2F;actress.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-9.png"
                      alt="Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Text-to-Speech"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 2: Language and Regions Settings!</strong></p>
<p>If your content is available in multiple languages and you want to convert all of the different editions of said content, you’ll need to find a converter that supports all of those languages. You may also consider looking for regional support as well. For example, for basic English language, most TTS converters usually have “American” voices as well as “British” voices to support different accents despite them using the same text.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-10.png"
                      alt="Language and Regions Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 3: Pick an Appropriate Voice!</strong></p>
<p>The voice you choose to read your text is also very important. Some premium <strong>text-to-human voice converters</strong> offer a great variety to choose from to give you options when it comes to what kind of voice you want to read your content.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-11.png"
                      alt="TTS Voices Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 4: Audio Settings!</strong></p>
<p>This is a bit of a rare feature, but some TTS converters will allow you to adjust your audio before it converts your <strong>content from text to speech (MP3)</strong>. Sometimes, this is as simple as allowing you to choose an audio format (as is shown in the image below), other times, it allows you to control the actual sound quality of the finished product.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-12.png"
                      alt="TTS Audio Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 5: Adjust Voice Speed!</strong></p>
<p>Earlier, we emphasized the importance of choosing your voice reader carefully! Now, we focus on the subject of speed. Some voices are better when they are slowed down, others are better when sped up. Play around with these settings to see which way is more natural for your chosen voice!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-13.png"
                      alt="TTS Voice Speed Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 6: Adjust Voice Pitch</strong></p>
<p>To allow for even more flexibility when it comes to voice style, you’ll find that some TTS converters will allow you to adjust voice pitch! This is a helpful feature for when you’re looking for that particular voice type, as it will allow you to experiment more with the kind of sound you want your content to be known for.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/Super%20Tips%20on%20Converting%20Text%20to%20MP3-14.png"
                      alt="Voice Pitch Settings"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 7: Voice Effects Options!</strong></p>
<p>Another advanced feature that you might run into (and should definitely take advantage of), is voice effects! This, again, will allow you to fully customize the type of voice that your content is known for. It’s also great for when you’re aiming for a more natural sound (if you’re patient enough in order to take full advantage of it!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Voice Effects Options"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Tip 8: Use Advanced Video Editing!</strong></p>
<p>Our last tip is not on the subject of using a TTS converter itself, but on the tool, you use in order to create your final project! For that, we recommend <strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong>.</p>

<p>Chromebooks are an excellent choice for educational institutions or businesses that require their employees to have constant access to the Internet. Even though these devices are a perfect tool that can accompany you on business trips and enable you to answer important emails or have access to crucial information stored on the cloud, performing more demanding tasks, like video editing, is still a challenge. However, it is far from impossible, although you may have to take a few extra steps before running a video editing software on your Chromebook.</p>
<p>Chrome OS is a Linux based environment and for that reason, Chromebook owners who would like to use professional editing software on their Chromebooks can install a Linux OS that will enable them to use programs such as Lightworks that are perfectly suited for high-end video editing. There are two different ways to install Linux on a Chromebook, you can either do it using Gallium OS or ChrUbuntu or in a Chroot environment using Crouton. Each of these methods is relatively easy and we will take you through the process step by step. Here’s how you can install Linux on your Chromebook.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Preparing-before-installing-Linux-OS-on-Chromebook"><a href="#Part-1-Preparing-before-installing-Linux-OS-on-Chromebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook"></a>Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook</h2><p>The first step of the process of installing the Linux OS is the decision itself, and you need to have all the necessary information before you decide to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the version of Chromebook you have is capable of supporting a Linux OS. Your device must be equipped with an ARM or Intel chip in order to be able to run the version of Linux OS you want to install. Although both chips will allow you to go through the process, running closed source software such the Steam is only possible with Intel chips.</li>
<li>Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.</li>
<li>Now that you are aware of the requirements and risks, you will have to backup all the files you have on your Chromebook because once you switch to the Developer Mode all the information stored locally will be erased. You can save the files on another computer or on the cloud depending on how much data you need to move and which one is more convenient for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Install-Linux-as-a-Chroot-Using-Crouton-on-Chromebook"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Install-Linux-as-a-Chroot-Using-Crouton-on-Chromebook" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook"></a>Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook</h2><p>After you have stored all your data safely, your Chromebook is ready for the beginning of the installation process of the secondary operating system. You will have to perform a series of actions that will allow you to start the installation, starting from accessing the Developer Mode.</p>
<h4 id="1-Acessing-the-developer-mode"><a href="#1-Acessing-the-developer-mode" class="headerlink" title="1. Acessing the developer mode"></a>1. Acessing the developer mode</h4><p>The first step of the process is to reboot your system, while your Chromebook is on. In order to do so hold Escape and Refresh keys on your keyboard and then hit the power button. Once your device is back online you will find yourself in the recovery mode, and you will see a message telling you to insert a recovery disc. Instead of inserting the disc, hold Ctrl+D and wait for OS verification menu to appear on the screen. At this point, if you are still having second thoughts about this process, you can hit the spacebar to return to recovery mode, or press Enter to proceed. Hitting Enter will delete all the data stored on your device and take you into the Developer Mode. Once your Chromebook lets you know that you are now in the Developer Mode, reboot the system and install a fresh version of the Chrome OS. Insert your login information and follow the instructions until you are looking at the Chrome OS desktop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-1.jpg"
                      alt="Install Linux on Chromebook"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Installing-Chroot"><a href="#2-Installing-Chroot" class="headerlink" title="2. Installing Chroot"></a>2. Installing Chroot</h4><p>At this stage of the process, your Chromebook is ready for the installation of the Crouton environment. Crouton is a series of scripts that makes running a Linux OS much easier, especially for inexperienced users. In order to download Crouton, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton" >GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and find the download link, detailed instructions or extensions that can add more functionality to your OS. Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook’s terminal a feature called ‘Crosh’. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the ‘shell’ command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: ‘sudo sh ~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;crouton -t xfce’ and if you want to install extensions you will have to add ‘xfce,extension’ command at the end.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-2.jpg"
                      alt="Install Linux on Chromebook"
                ></p>
<p>Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: ‘sudo enter-chroot startxfce4’. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.</p>
<h4 id="3-Optimizing-your-new-OS"><a href="#3-Optimizing-your-new-OS" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimizing your new OS"></a>3. Optimizing your new OS</h4><p>You may have to optimize your new OS in order to improve the experience of using it. Enabling your keyboard’s brightness and volume keys inside the new OS can be done easily by holding CTRL+ALT+T and then typing shell once you’ve accessed Chrome OS’s shell and hit Enter. Issue the following command: ‘sudo sh -e ~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;crouton-r precise-t keyboard–u’ and then press Enter again. Removing the screen saver or installing more extensions may also be a good way to enable more options in the new OS. Most importantly, you can now download and install the video editing software you want to use for editing your footage.</p>
<h4 id="4-Remove-Chroot-from-your-Chromebook"><a href="#4-Remove-Chroot-from-your-Chromebook" class="headerlink" title="4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook"></a>4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook</h4><p>If for some reason you want to uninstall Linux from your Chromebook, simply reboot the system and press the spacebar when the ‘OS verification is off’ message appears on the screen. In this manner, you will exit the Developer Mode and all locally stored data, including all installed environments, will be deleted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-ChrUbuntu"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-ChrUbuntu" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu"></a>Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu</h2><p>An alternative option is available for Chromebook users that have Intel based devices like recently released Haswell models. The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn’t advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.</p>
<h4 id="1-Preparation-for-the-installation"><a href="#1-Preparation-for-the-installation" class="headerlink" title="1. Preparation for the installation"></a>1. Preparation for the installation</h4><p>Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type ‘chronos’ and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: ‘curl -L -O <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://goo.gl/9sgchs" >http://goo.gl/9sgchs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; sudo bash 9sgchs’ and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you’ve made your choice press Enter.</p>
<h4 id="2-Installing-ChrUbuntu"><a href="#2-Installing-ChrUbuntu" class="headerlink" title="2. Installing ChrUbuntu"></a>2. Installing ChrUbuntu</h4><p>Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing ‘chronos’ to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.</p>
<p>Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the ‘OS Verification is Off’ notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Uninstall-ChrUbuntu"><a href="#3-Uninstall-ChrUbuntu" class="headerlink" title="3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu"></a>3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu</h4><p>Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert ‘chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageburner’ in your browser’s address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-Gallium-OS"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-Gallium-OS" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS"></a>Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS</h2><p>If neither Chroot nor ChrUbuntu work for you, using Gallium OS may be the right choice. The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn’t complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.</p>
<h4 id="1-Preparation-for-the-installation-1"><a href="#1-Preparation-for-the-installation-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Preparation for the installation"></a>1. Preparation for the installation</h4><p>In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device’s Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility" >Hardware Compatibility <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page will provide the information regarding the CPU’s family, which can be crucial for the OS’ performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn’t allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.</p>
<h4 id="2-Enabling-the-Legacy-Mode"><a href="#2-Enabling-the-Legacy-Mode" class="headerlink" title="2. Enabling the Legacy Mode"></a>2. Enabling the Legacy Mode</h4><p>Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ‘ OS verification is OFF’ notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you’ve successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the ‘Crosh’ terminal and then type ‘shell’. At the ‘chronos&#x2F;localhost&#x2F;$ issue the following command: ‘sudo crossystem dev_boot_legacy&#x3D;1’. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.</p>
<h4 id="3-Installation-process"><a href="#3-Installation-process" class="headerlink" title="3. Installation process"></a>3. Installation process</h4><p>If you choose to install Gallium OS through Chrome OS command line using Chrx that will enable you to dual-boot your Chromebook, you should start by booting the device into Chrome OS and configuring networking. The next step you’ll need to take is switching to a virtual terminal by holding Ctrl+Alt+F2, and then you should log in as user chronos without a password. Once you’ve completed this step issue the following command: ‘curl -O <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chrx.org/go" >https://chrx.org/go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &amp;&amp; sh go’ and follow the on-screen instructions to repartition your hard-drive and install the Gallium OS. Once the installation is over reboot the device and press Ctrl+L when the ‘OS Verification is Off’ notification appears on the screen to boot Gallium OS or hold Ctrl+D to access Chrome OS. After the Gallium OS is successfully installed on your Chromebook you can start using programs such as Skype or Lightworks.</p>

<p>Chromebooks are an excellent choice for educational institutions or businesses that require their employees to have constant access to the Internet. Even though these devices are a perfect tool that can accompany you on business trips and enable you to answer important emails or have access to crucial information stored on the cloud, performing more demanding tasks, like video editing, is still a challenge. However, it is far from impossible, although you may have to take a few extra steps before running a video editing software on your Chromebook.</p>
<p>Chrome OS is a Linux based environment and for that reason, Chromebook owners who would like to use professional editing software on their Chromebooks can install a Linux OS that will enable them to use programs such as Lightworks that are perfectly suited for high-end video editing. There are two different ways to install Linux on a Chromebook, you can either do it using Gallium OS or ChrUbuntu or in a Chroot environment using Crouton. Each of these methods is relatively easy and we will take you through the process step by step. Here’s how you can install Linux on your Chromebook.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-Preparing-before-installing-Linux-OS-on-Chromebook-1"><a href="#Part-1-Preparing-before-installing-Linux-OS-on-Chromebook-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook"></a>Part 1: Preparing before installing Linux OS on Chromebook</h2><p>The first step of the process of installing the Linux OS is the decision itself, and you need to have all the necessary information before you decide to install a Linux OS on your Chromebook.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that the version of Chromebook you have is capable of supporting a Linux OS. Your device must be equipped with an ARM or Intel chip in order to be able to run the version of Linux OS you want to install. Although both chips will allow you to go through the process, running closed source software such the Steam is only possible with Intel chips.</li>
<li>Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.</li>
<li>Now that you are aware of the requirements and risks, you will have to backup all the files you have on your Chromebook because once you switch to the Developer Mode all the information stored locally will be erased. You can save the files on another computer or on the cloud depending on how much data you need to move and which one is more convenient for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Install-Linux-as-a-Chroot-Using-Crouton-on-Chromebook-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Install-Linux-as-a-Chroot-Using-Crouton-on-Chromebook-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook"></a>Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook</h2><p>After you have stored all your data safely, your Chromebook is ready for the beginning of the installation process of the secondary operating system. You will have to perform a series of actions that will allow you to start the installation, starting from accessing the Developer Mode.</p>
<h4 id="1-Acessing-the-developer-mode-1"><a href="#1-Acessing-the-developer-mode-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Acessing the developer mode"></a>1. Acessing the developer mode</h4><p>The first step of the process is to reboot your system, while your Chromebook is on. In order to do so hold Escape and Refresh keys on your keyboard and then hit the power button. Once your device is back online you will find yourself in the recovery mode, and you will see a message telling you to insert a recovery disc. Instead of inserting the disc, hold Ctrl+D and wait for OS verification menu to appear on the screen. At this point, if you are still having second thoughts about this process, you can hit the spacebar to return to recovery mode, or press Enter to proceed. Hitting Enter will delete all the data stored on your device and take you into the Developer Mode. Once your Chromebook lets you know that you are now in the Developer Mode, reboot the system and install a fresh version of the Chrome OS. Insert your login information and follow the instructions until you are looking at the Chrome OS desktop.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/install-linux-on-chromebook-1.jpg"
                      alt="Install Linux on Chromebook"
                ></p>
<h4 id="2-Installing-Chroot-1"><a href="#2-Installing-Chroot-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Installing Chroot"></a>2. Installing Chroot</h4><p>At this stage of the process, your Chromebook is ready for the installation of the Crouton environment. Crouton is a series of scripts that makes running a Linux OS much easier, especially for inexperienced users. In order to download Crouton, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton" >GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and find the download link, detailed instructions or extensions that can add more functionality to your OS. Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook’s terminal a feature called ‘Crosh’. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the ‘shell’ command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: ‘sudo sh ~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;crouton -t xfce’ and if you want to install extensions you will have to add ‘xfce,extension’ command at the end.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Install Linux on Chromebook"
                ></p>
<p>Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: ‘sudo enter-chroot startxfce4’. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.</p>
<h4 id="3-Optimizing-your-new-OS-1"><a href="#3-Optimizing-your-new-OS-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Optimizing your new OS"></a>3. Optimizing your new OS</h4><p>You may have to optimize your new OS in order to improve the experience of using it. Enabling your keyboard’s brightness and volume keys inside the new OS can be done easily by holding CTRL+ALT+T and then typing shell once you’ve accessed Chrome OS’s shell and hit Enter. Issue the following command: ‘sudo sh -e ~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;crouton-r precise-t keyboard–u’ and then press Enter again. Removing the screen saver or installing more extensions may also be a good way to enable more options in the new OS. Most importantly, you can now download and install the video editing software you want to use for editing your footage.</p>
<h4 id="4-Remove-Chroot-from-your-Chromebook-1"><a href="#4-Remove-Chroot-from-your-Chromebook-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook"></a>4. Remove Chroot from your Chromebook</h4><p>If for some reason you want to uninstall Linux from your Chromebook, simply reboot the system and press the spacebar when the ‘OS verification is off’ message appears on the screen. In this manner, you will exit the Developer Mode and all locally stored data, including all installed environments, will be deleted.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-ChrUbuntu-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-ChrUbuntu-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu"></a>Part 3: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using ChrUbuntu</h2><p>An alternative option is available for Chromebook users that have Intel based devices like recently released Haswell models. The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn’t advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.</p>
<h4 id="1-Preparation-for-the-installation-2"><a href="#1-Preparation-for-the-installation-2" class="headerlink" title="1. Preparation for the installation"></a>1. Preparation for the installation</h4><p>Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type ‘chronos’ and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: ‘curl -L -O <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://goo.gl/9sgchs" >http://goo.gl/9sgchs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; sudo bash 9sgchs’ and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you’ve made your choice press Enter.</p>
<h4 id="2-Installing-ChrUbuntu-1"><a href="#2-Installing-ChrUbuntu-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Installing ChrUbuntu"></a>2. Installing ChrUbuntu</h4><p>Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing ‘chronos’ to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.</p>
<p>Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the ‘OS Verification is Off’ notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.</p>

                ></p>
<h4 id="3-Uninstall-ChrUbuntu-1"><a href="#3-Uninstall-ChrUbuntu-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu"></a>3. Uninstall ChrUbuntu</h4><p>Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert ‘chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageburner’ in your browser’s address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-Gallium-OS-1"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Dual-Boot-a-Chromebook-Using-Gallium-OS-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS"></a>Part 4: How to Dual-Boot a Chromebook Using Gallium OS</h2><p>If neither Chroot nor ChrUbuntu work for you, using Gallium OS may be the right choice. The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn’t complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.</p>
<h4 id="1-Preparation-for-the-installation-3"><a href="#1-Preparation-for-the-installation-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Preparation for the installation"></a>1. Preparation for the installation</h4><p>In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device’s Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility" >Hardware Compatibility <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page will provide the information regarding the CPU’s family, which can be crucial for the OS’ performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn’t allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.</p>
<h4 id="2-Enabling-the-Legacy-Mode-1"><a href="#2-Enabling-the-Legacy-Mode-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Enabling the Legacy Mode"></a>2. Enabling the Legacy Mode</h4><p>Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ‘ OS verification is OFF’ notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you’ve successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the ‘Crosh’ terminal and then type ‘shell’. At the ‘chronos&#x2F;localhost&#x2F;$ issue the following command: ‘sudo crossystem dev_boot_legacy&#x3D;1’. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.</p>
<h4 id="3-Installation-process-1"><a href="#3-Installation-process-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Installation process"></a>3. Installation process</h4><p>If you choose to install Gallium OS through Chrome OS command line using Chrx that will enable you to dual-boot your Chromebook, you should start by booting the device into Chrome OS and configuring networking. The next step you’ll need to take is switching to a virtual terminal by holding Ctrl+Alt+F2, and then you should log in as user chronos without a password. Once you’ve completed this step issue the following command: ‘curl -O <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://chrx.org/go" >https://chrx.org/go <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> &amp;&amp; sh go’ and follow the on-screen instructions to repartition your hard-drive and install the Gallium OS. Once the installation is over reboot the device and press Ctrl+L when the ‘OS Verification is Off’ notification appears on the screen to boot Gallium OS or hold Ctrl+D to access Chrome OS. After the Gallium OS is successfully installed on your Chromebook you can start using programs such as Skype or Lightworks.</p>

The ChrUbuntu can be installed on the USB stick or external hard-drive or directly to the local memory of your Chromebook. Even though ARM-based machines can also use ChrUbuntu it isn’t advisable because they may perform poorly due to slower processor speeds and less RAM power. Unlike Chroot, ChrUbuntu will not allow you to switch between operating systems without a reboot, and if the system is stored locally, you may need to go through the full system recovery.</p>
<h4 id="1-Preparation-for-the-installation-4"><a href="#1-Preparation-for-the-installation-4" class="headerlink" title="1. Preparation for the installation"></a>1. Preparation for the installation</h4><p>Like with the previous method you will have to go into the Developer Mode and make sure that you have access to a WiFi connection. When you are asked to provide your login details, instead of entering them press Ctrl+Alt+Forward and then type ‘chronos’ and press Enter. The next step will require you to issue the following command: ‘curl -L -O <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://goo.gl/9sgchs" >http://goo.gl/9sgchs <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>; sudo bash 9sgchs’ and then once more hit Enter. Again press Enter after the information about the installation is displayed on the screen and then you will be asked to decide how much space you want to allocate for Linux installation. Experts say that 9GB is the upper limit. After you’ve made your choice press Enter.</p>
<h4 id="2-Installing-ChrUbuntu-2"><a href="#2-Installing-ChrUbuntu-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Installing ChrUbuntu"></a>2. Installing ChrUbuntu</h4><p>Once the partitioning of your hard-drive is completed, you will have to repeat the first several steps from typing ‘chronos’ to pressing enter when information about the installation is displayed on the screen. The installation process is now in progress and you will be occasionally asked to select a few settings, make sure you always click on default. At the end of the installation process, you will have to choose the location where GRUB should be installed, please select &#x2F;dev&#x2F;sda, because the failure to do so may interrupt the installation.</p>
<p>Once the installation is completed, restart your Chromebook to finalize the process, and when you see the ‘OS Verification is Off’ notification press Ctrl+L to access Linux or Ctrl+D boot into Chrome OS.</p>

Uninstall ChrUbuntu</h4><p>Removing ChrUbuntu is a relatively painless process that can be completed with just a few simple commands. If the OS is stored locally the only way to erase it is to perform a full system recovery. While all your data located on the cloud will re-sync with your Chromebook, the data stored locally will be deleted, which is why it is important to backup all the important files before starting a system recovery process. The fastest and easiest way to perform a system recovery is by creating a recovery disk from your device. Insert ‘chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;imageburner’ in your browser’s address bar, and carefully read and follow the instructions.</p>
<p>This Linux removal method will also require you to have a USB stick with a minimum of 4GB of storage space. After you created the disk, you can go into the Recovery Mode, by holding Esc and Refresh buttons simultaneously and then pressing the Power button. In the Recovery Mode, you will be asked to insert the recovery disk and the process will be on the way.</p>

The Gallium is Xbuntu-based OS that is equipped with touchpad mouse drivers among other advantages it offers over other operating systems. The installation process isn’t complicated, although it may require more effort than installing Crouton.</p>
<h4 id="1-Preparation-for-the-installation-5"><a href="#1-Preparation-for-the-installation-5" class="headerlink" title="1. Preparation for the installation"></a>1. Preparation for the installation</h4><p>In order to be aware of all the preparation steps, you need to take, you must first find out your device’s Hardware ID number and you can obtain this information by navigating to Chrome:&#x2F;&#x2F;System, Hardware Class within the Chrome OS. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://wiki.galliumos.org/Hardware%5FCompatibility" >Hardware Compatibility <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> page will provide the information regarding the CPU’s family, which can be crucial for the OS’ performance. You can run the installation either from an ISO image on an external USB drive or from the Chrome OS command line using Chrx. We will describe how to install Gallium OS from the Chrome OS command line because the other option doesn’t allow you to dual-boot your Chromebook.</p>
<h4 id="2-Enabling-the-Legacy-Mode-2"><a href="#2-Enabling-the-Legacy-Mode-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Enabling the Legacy Mode"></a>2. Enabling the Legacy Mode</h4><p>Like previously described, enter the Developer Mode and when the ‘ OS verification is OFF’ notification appears on the screen proceed to enable the Legacy Mode. You can do this by holding CTRL+D keys to enable the Chrome OS to boot in the Developer Mode. After you’ve successfully made this step, press CTRl+ALT+T to access the ‘Crosh’ terminal and then type ‘shell’. At the ‘chronos&#x2F;localhost&#x2F;$ issue the following command: ‘sudo crossystem dev_boot_legacy&#x3D;1’. Update and install all the necessary firmware by running the Firmware Utility Script.</p>

<p>Chromebooks are an excellent choice for educational institutions or businesses that require their employees to have constant access to the Internet. Even though these devices are a perfect tool that can accompany you on business trips and enable you to answer important emails or have access to crucial information stored on the cloud, performing more demanding tasks, like video editing, is still a challenge. However, it is far from impossible, although you may have to take a few extra steps before running a video editing software on your Chromebook.</p>
<p>Chrome OS is a Linux based environment and for that reason, Chromebook owners who would like to use professional editing software on their Chromebooks can install a Linux OS that will enable them to use programs such as Lightworks that are perfectly suited for high-end video editing. There are two different ways to install Linux on a Chromebook, you can either do it using Gallium OS or ChrUbuntu or in a Chroot environment using Crouton. Each of these methods is relatively easy and we will take you through the process step by step. Here’s how you can install Linux on your Chromebook.</p>

<ul>
<li>Make sure that the version of Chromebook you have is capable of supporting a Linux OS. Your device must be equipped with an ARM or Intel chip in order to be able to run the version of Linux OS you want to install. Although both chips will allow you to go through the process, running closed source software such the Steam is only possible with Intel chips.</li>
<li>Regardless of which method of installing Linux OS you choose, you will have to switch to the Developer Mode, a special built-in function that allows you to install the unapproved operating system, among other things.</li>
<li>Now that you are aware of the requirements and risks, you will have to backup all the files you have on your Chromebook because once you switch to the Developer Mode all the information stored locally will be erased. You can save the files on another computer or on the cloud depending on how much data you need to move and which one is more convenient for you.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Install-Linux-as-a-Chroot-Using-Crouton-on-Chromebook-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Install-Linux-as-a-Chroot-Using-Crouton-on-Chromebook-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook"></a>Part 2: How to Install Linux as a Chroot Using Crouton on Chromebook</h2><p>After you have stored all your data safely, your Chromebook is ready for the beginning of the installation process of the secondary operating system. You will have to perform a series of actions that will allow you to start the installation, starting from accessing the Developer Mode.</p>
<h4 id="1-Acessing-the-developer-mode-3"><a href="#1-Acessing-the-developer-mode-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Acessing the developer mode"></a>1. Acessing the developer mode</h4><p>The first step of the process is to reboot your system, while your Chromebook is on. In order to do so hold Escape and Refresh keys on your keyboard and then hit the power button. Once your device is back online you will find yourself in the recovery mode, and you will see a message telling you to insert a recovery disc. Instead of inserting the disc, hold Ctrl+D and wait for OS verification menu to appear on the screen. At this point, if you are still having second thoughts about this process, you can hit the spacebar to return to recovery mode, or press Enter to proceed. Hitting Enter will delete all the data stored on your device and take you into the Developer Mode. Once your Chromebook lets you know that you are now in the Developer Mode, reboot the system and install a fresh version of the Chrome OS. Insert your login information and follow the instructions until you are looking at the Chrome OS desktop.</p>

<h4 id="2-Installing-Chroot-3"><a href="#2-Installing-Chroot-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Installing Chroot"></a>2. Installing Chroot</h4><p>At this stage of the process, your Chromebook is ready for the installation of the Crouton environment. Crouton is a series of scripts that makes running a Linux OS much easier, especially for inexperienced users. In order to download Crouton, go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/dnschneid/crouton" >GitHub <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and find the download link, detailed instructions or extensions that can add more functionality to your OS. Once the installation file or files are in the Download folder, your next step is to access the Chromebook’s terminal a feature called ‘Crosh’. The fastest way to do this is to hold CTRL + ALT keys and then hit the T key. This action will cause the Chrome window to appear on the screen, and you will need to type the ‘shell’ command without using quotation marks. Afterwards, enter the following command: ‘sudo sh ~&#x2F;Downloads&#x2F;crouton -t xfce’ and if you want to install extensions you will have to add ‘xfce,extension’ command at the end.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Press the Enter key and wait for the system to start setting up the Chroot. This process may take a while, so it is important to be patient, but more importantly, do not interfere with it in any way. Installation of your secondary OS is now on the way, and you may be asked to insert your login data, like your Gmail username and password. Wait patiently until the process is over and then return to shell and enter this command: ‘sudo enter-chroot startxfce4’. Your screen will go black for a while, but after the black screen is gone your Chromebook will be in the freshly installed Linux OS.</p>

<p><strong>What we don’t like:</strong> The software isn’t easy to use and inexperienced editors will find it difficult to use at first.</p>
<p>Lightworks Resolve may not be as popular as Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro, but that doesn’t mean that this video editing software isn’t as capable as its more popular counterparts.</p>
<p>The software is compatible with Mac, Windows, and Linux OS, which makes it a perfect choice for Chromebook users that have a Linux OS installed on their devices. Lightworks features literally every editing tool imaginable and for that reason, it is a perfect choice for editing videos you would like to upload to Vimeo or YouTube or high-end professional projects. This editing software offers plenty of transitions and visual effects that will help its users to create seamless jumps between shots and visually impressive videos.</p>
