If you wish to create a looping video, you’ll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.</p>
<h3 id="1-Window-Media-Player-3"><a href="#1-Window-Media-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Window Media Player"></a>1. Window Media Player</h3><p>Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company’s de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.</p>
<p>Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.</p>
<p><strong>How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in <strong>Now Playing</strong> status to reveal the <em>playback settings</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> To continually repeat the movie, click the <strong>Turn Repeat On</strong> button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.</p>
<p>(<strong>Note:</strong> If you don’t see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square <strong>Maximize</strong> symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Until you exit the application or click the <strong>Turn Repeat Off</strong> icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.</p>

                ></p>
<p> <strong>Note:</strong> When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the <strong>Repeat</strong> feature.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player-3"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player-3" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2.

<p>You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.</p>
<p>It can also play your video on loop. Here’s how:</p>
