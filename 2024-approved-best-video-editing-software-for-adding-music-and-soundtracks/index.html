This is where a <strong>face generation portal</strong> comes into play. You can easily <strong>create a virtual face</strong> that looks almost like you and sometimes even better with a face generator.</p>
<p>Similarly, run a business where you want to publish your clients’ reviews without showing their real photos as they might not like the idea. You can use a good face generator online tool to create a virtual face that resembles their look and post it along with their feedback.</p>
<p>Considering the above scenarios and many others that may come up over time, the following list some of the best free online face generators to create fake faces.</p>

<p>This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more. You can be as creative as you want to generate a face that appears somewhat like you with the available options. Once a look is generated, you can download and use it as needed.</p>
<p>The steps that are given below explain how you can use Generated Photos’ Faces section to create and download a virtual face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your favorite web browser and go to the URL given above, and then you will see all free AI-generated photos on this website.</li>
</ul>

<p>Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:</p>
<ul>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Different browsers may have this feature with other names</p>

<p>This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click <strong>Generate Another Fake Human</strong> if you don’t like the one that appears;</li>
<li>Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Generate A Human</strong> button to create a less realistic image of a random person.</li>

<p>faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.</p>
<p>You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click <strong>Start</strong> from the main page.</li>
<li>Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Continue</strong> on the next page.

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Different browsers may have this feature with other names</p>

<p>This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click <strong>Generate Another Fake Human</strong> if you don’t like the one that appears;</li>
<li>Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Generate A Human</strong> button to create a less realistic image of a random person.</li>

<p>faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.</p>
<p>You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click <strong>Start</strong> from the main page.</li>
<li>Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Continue</strong> on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>We all record more videos with our Smartphones or cameras than we can possibly share on social media, and we often don’t get the chance to show some of our favorite moments to our friends. Video collage apps for iPhones and iPads offer an easy solution to this problem because they enable you to merge multiple video clips into a single video. You don’t even need to have advanced video editing skills in order to create visually stunning video collages, as most of these apps are extremely easy to use. So in this article, we are going to take you through some of the best video collage apps of iOS devices.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-and-Paid-Video-Collage-Apps-for-iPhone-and-iPad"><a href="#Best-Free-and-Paid-Video-Collage-Apps-for-iPhone-and-iPad" class="headerlink" title="Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad"></a>Best Free and Paid Video Collage Apps for iPhone and iPad</h2><p>Even though selecting a video collage app isn’t a very complicated process, there are still a number of factors you need to consider before you choose to install a video collage app on your iPad or iPhone. Checking the list of features an app offers and making sure that it allows you to adjust each clip you include in a collage separately or to add music to your creations will help you determine if the app you’re interested in is the right choice for you. The selection of video collage presets or the border and background adjustment features should also be considered while choosing a video collage app. Let’s take a look at some of the best video collage apps you can find at the AppStore.</p>
<h4 id="1-Video-Collage-and-Photo-Grid"><a href="#1-Video-Collage-and-Photo-Grid" class="headerlink" title="1. Video Collage and Photo Grid"></a>1. Video Collage and Photo Grid</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

                ></p>
<p>As its name suggests, this app allows you to create both photo and video collages. You can either use the existing material from your camera roll or use the Video Collage and Photo Grid app to capture new footage. You can choose from 64 fully customizable layouts and pick the texture or the color of the frames of each video or photo you include in the collage. The app also lets you adjust the sizes of the still and moving images you’re combining and it also offers the possibility to crop photos you’d like to use in your collages. The sound volume can be easily adjusted, but you must make an in-app purchase in order to unlock the background music feature.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This versatile app can be used for much more than just creating video collages, as it offers the option to capture videos in Full HD and 4K resolutions, although the 4K option is only available on iPhone Xs and iPad Pro. Moreover, you can combine several video collages into a single video and apply a variety of transitions to ensure the smooth flow of the output video. Adding text layers, recording voiceovers or creating soundtracks for your video collages are just a few options you’ll have at your disposal if you install the PicPlayPost movie video editor on your iOS-based device. In case you’re planning on using this app on a daily basis, you should consider purchasing the Everything Pack that costs just $24.99.</p>
<h4 id="3-PicStich"><a href="#3-PicStich" class="headerlink" title="3. PicStich"></a>3. PicStich</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

                ></p>
<p>The fact that PicStich offers more than 300 different layouts speaks volumes about its capabilities. However, the majority of the app’s features are designed to help you create photo collages. You can still add a song you like to a video collage to make it more entertaining to watch, but unfortunately, PicStich doesn’t let you apply transitions or adjust playback speeds of the videos you include in a video collage. Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

Purchasing Frames and Borders packs will extend the scope of your options and enable you to increase the quality of the video collages you’re making. The app’s file-sharing capabilities are impressive since you can export your projects directly to Instagram or Dropbox and you can also share all of your creations to Facebook, Twitter, and other popular social networks.</p>

Besides making video collages, you can also use the PicCollage Grid &amp; Video Editor to create animated collages. The only downside is that all photo or video collages you create with the free version of the app are going to be watermarked.</p>

<p>VidsStitch was designed exclusively for iPhones and iPads, and it works best with the videos captured on these devices. The process of creating a new video collage can be completed in just a few quick steps. You should start by choosing one of the pre-designed frames, then you should just import and arrange your videos within the frame and decide whether you want to post the video collage on Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. The free version of VidStich is going to watermark all your creations and it won’t allow you to add music to your collages, which is why purchasing the Pro pack and additional frames and borders will help you produce visual content that is going to impress your followers on social media.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Presentation of the videos you record with your iPhone or iPad is as important as their overall quality.
