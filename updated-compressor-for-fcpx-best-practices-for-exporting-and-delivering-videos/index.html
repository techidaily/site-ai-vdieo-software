<p>With these apps, you can modify videos on your smartphones or computers easily. And if you’ve invested in an iPhone 13 Pro or iPhone 13 Pro Max that can capture video in the high-resolution ProRes standard, you’ll find reliable software to make the most of your video. We’ll go over which applications are excellent for specific chores and provide statistics to help you discover the best match. Let’s get started!</p>
<h2 id="Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try"><a href="#Apple-Apps-for-Video-Editing-You-Should-Try" class="headerlink" title="Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try"></a>Apple Apps for Video Editing You Should Try</h2><p>In today’s world, photos and videos are an integral part of everyone’s life. Mobile phones, laptops, and cameras may all be used to capture them. But, it might not be easy to organize and decorate them according to one’s unique preferences. Fortunately, there are several tools available to help Apple users with these tasks.</p>
<p>In the following part, I will introduce 5 best apple video editing software, including its unique features listed.</p>
<h3 id="1-Photos"><a href="#1-Photos" class="headerlink" title="1. Photos"></a>1. Photos</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPadOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>The number one on our list is the Photos app. It’s among the most well-known application for video editing enthusiasts in the iOS community. This is an application mostly used by professional designers and developers who are into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Photos App?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Inc. created Photos, a picture storage and editing program. Its main features are its simplicity and ease of usage. Its very name is a lovely and obvious indication of its use. Since 2015, this Mac picture editing app has been offered for OS X Yosemite 10.10.3 and tvOS v.10.</p>
<p>Filters and Smart Sliders are among the editing tools available in this program. It also has the Mark-up tool that allows you to <strong>add text</strong>, shapes, and doodles, as well as signatures. What’s more, you can <strong>rotate, crop and auto enhance</strong> videos in this app as well. Like photos editing, if you are not satisfied with the editing, you can tap <strong>Revert</strong> to restore to the original version.</p>
<p>If you are using the Photos app on iPhone 13 and iPhone 13 Pro, you can <strong>adjust the focus points and the depth of the field</strong> in Cinematic mode to make a cinematic-looking video easily.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Videos Anywhere with iCloud Photo Library</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The connection with iCloud Picture Library is where Photos outperforms every other Mac image editing tool. This fantastic feature allows users to fill out their libraries rather than their devices. This is accomplished by syncing photographs and videos across all Apple devices, including the iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, MacBook and Apple Watch.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Moments</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Photos employs Moments as an organizer, which may be used to build categories and years. Moments are a mix of the photo’s time and location information. Furthermore, facial recognition enables users to create groups based on a person, among other things.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Themes</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Themes, which allow users to make calendars, picture albums, and other projects, complement the modifying and organizing capabilities. The program also provides printing capabilities for professional results.</p>
<h3 id="2-QuickTime-Player"><a href="#2-QuickTime-Player" class="headerlink" title="2. QuickTime Player"></a>2. QuickTime Player</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;macOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>Next on our list is the QuickTime Player that lets you do almost whatever you want to do with your videos and pictures. The app is built to support both beginners and professionals. However, we would lean more towards beginners because most professionals today prefer apps like iMovie or Final Cut Pro. But that’s not to say this one doesn’t have excellent features to offer.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with QuickTime Player App?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Trim, Combine,</strong> <strong>Rotate, Split MOV Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Everyone wants to make their lengthy videos short. QuickTime allows you to do precisely that with its trimming feature. Make your videos short and catchy with this feature. Further, you can combine two videos to make one excellent video for your presentation. The app also allows you to split different videos and combine them to produce more quality content.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Record Screen and Voiceover</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you think your video footage can do well with a background voiceover of someone else, QuickTime Player allows you to record your audios in the background while your video plays smoothly. You can also record the desktop screen with the Player.</p>
<p><em>Check how to use</em> <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><em>QuickTime</em> <em>Player to Record Desktop Screen and Audio</em></a></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shrink Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>If you believe your video looks better with a small size in appearance, try shrinking it using the shrink feature in the QuickTime Player. You can lower the video quality from 1080p, 720p to whatever your phone or Mac storage deems compatible.</p>
<h3 id="3-Clips"><a href="#3-Clips" class="headerlink" title="3. Clips"></a>3. Clips</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPad</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to Use</p>
<p>You might not have heard of Clips as much as you may have heard about the others on this list. But don’t sleep on this one. Clips have slowly but surely gained the attraction of expert video editors, and you’d see almost all of them having Clips on their iPhones or Macs.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with Clips?</strong></p>
<p>Apple Clips is interesting to check out when you’re an iOS fan. You can use this free video editing app to record and edit 16:9, 4:3 or square videos with various camera effects, stunning filters, animated text, music, emoji, stickers, and more, and then share it with your friends or family.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Family-Oriented</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips is mainly oriented towards families and children, and it isn’t even close to the capabilities of iMovie. Nonetheless, it is moving closer to be a genuine video editing program with each new version.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>AR Spaces</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Apple Clips, for instance, introduced AR Spaces, an augmented reality function for iPhone 12 Pro and iPad Pro owners, in April.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Furthermore, the most recent version in September enables you to import and edit video shot in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 and ProRes footage from the iPhone 13 Pro and Pro Max.</p>
<h3 id="4-iMovie"><a href="#4-iMovie" class="headerlink" title="4. iMovie"></a>4. iMovie</h3><p><strong>Supported By:</strong> iOS&#x2F;iPadOS&#x2F;macOS</p>
<p><strong>Pricing:</strong> Free to use</p>
<p>One of the most recognizable apps in the Apple market for video editing software is the iMovie app. Almost all professional experts are reaping the benefits of using the iMovie app. The app developers have emphasized greatly equipping the professionals and the newbies who so desperately want to make their mark into the video editing profession.</p>
<p><strong>What Can You Do with iMovie?</strong></p>
<p>iMovie, is more like Final Cut Pro X’s younger sibling. But it’s free with your Mac, so there’s no danger in giving it a shot. It’s an excellent option for newcomers learning to use editing software, casual enthusiasts, and even YouTubers who wish to cut up their films.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Merge, Cut, Trim: Pull off Everything!</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Although iMovie is rather simple, this may be considered a benefit for inexperienced editors. You can combine, cut, and rearrange your original video and audio with iMovie.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4K Video Editing</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>You may even export your work in 4K quality at up to 60 frames per second once you’ve done it. Many effects, transitions, filters, and fine-tuning settings for white balance, color matching, and audio isolation are also included.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cinematic Mode</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>In September, iMovie received a major upgrade, which included importing and editing footage taken in Cinematic mode on the iPhone 13 to Macs. You may now add, tweak, and delete focus points, as well as change the depths of field effect in a video shot in Cinematic mode, assuming you have a modern iPhone or iPad.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

<p>We’ve picked out some of the best <strong>audio converters</strong> available right now based on several different factors</p>
<p>You’ll be able to see for yourself just how good each audio converter actually is.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Convert-Audio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 How to Convert Audio?"></a>Part 1 <strong>How to Convert Audio?</strong></h2><p>Before we start listing the best <strong>audio converters</strong> down, we’ve prepared a bit of an overview for you! With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>

                      alt="Launch Audio Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Audio for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Audio File Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Start Conversion!</strong></p>
<p>Once the output format has been chosen, you can proceed with initializing the conversion! Usually, this is as simple as selecting ‘CONVERT’.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download or Save File!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion has been completed, your <strong>audio converter</strong> will either give you an option to ‘DOWNLOAD’ or ‘SAVE’ the finished product to your device!</p>

We played around with the settings, tried out all compatible formats, determined their efficiency, intuitiveness, extra features, and so much more!</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-1"><a href="#Part-3-Essential-Features-of-Audio-Converter-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 Essential Features of Audio Converter Software"></a>Part 3 <strong>Essential Features of Audio Converter Software</strong></h2><p>There are three essential features that one needs to consider to decide which is the best <strong>audio converter</strong> software for them:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio? You might find some of these features to be not useful at this moment in time. But, you never know!</p>

We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best <strong>audio converter</strong> for each type of user…</p>

<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>For the next item on our list, we have EaseUs Video Converter! If Filmora Pro is the jack of all trades, EaseUs Video Converter is the master of its trade. As a converter true and true, it is capable of more advanced conversions. Case in point, the software supports over 300 audio formats (including some of the obscure ones!) It also offers basic video and audio editing for perfecting projects!</p>

With this first part being a tutorial for how to use an <strong>audio converter</strong>! The example that we’ll be using is the 6th of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on our list, but it’s also the most general one. So, even if you decide to choose another, you should still be able to learn from this tutorial!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch The Audio Converter!</strong></p>
<p>The first step in any conversion, of course, is to have it all primed for conversion! The <strong>free audio converter</strong> that we’ll be using as our example is an online one, so there is no actual ‘launching’ but one must open it up anyway through the link provided!</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload Audio File!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to ‘Upload’ the audio file that you want to convert. Usually, this can be done either by making use of the drag-and-drop function or selecting the ‘UPLOAD’ function that will allow you to browse your device for the audio file.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>The next general step is to select the output format for the file that you want to convert! You can usually choose a whole array of formats for this: MP3, M4A, WAV, OGG, FLAC, WMA, M4R, AIFF, MMF, OPUS, MIDI, etc.</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Input Formats and Output Formats</strong>: These are the most basic of the basic when it comes to requirements, but it’s notable regardless! After all, if your audio converter ends up being so limited that it is incapable of converting some of the more obscure formats out there, you might find it useless in the future.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Conversion Speed</strong>: No one has the time to spend endlessly on their computer to wait for a file to convert. Everything has a deadline! So, the speed of conversion is definitely something to consider.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Bonus Features</strong>: What other features does this audio converter have in store for you? Will it allow you to create playlists? Trim your audio? Merge your audio?

<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

We’ve made sure to include a variety below! Note, this list is not in any particular order as we arranged it in a way to highlight the best <strong>audio converter</strong> for each type of user…</p>
<h3 id="01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3"><a href="#01-Wondershare-Filmora-Video-Editor-3" class="headerlink" title="01**Wondershare Filmora Video Editor**"></a>01**<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>**</h3><p><strong>Supported OS:</strong> Windows&#x2F;Mac</p>

<p><strong>CNET Rating:</strong> 4&#x2F;5</p>
<p>The first of the <strong>audio converters</strong> on this list is Filmora Pro! Filmora Pro is not necessarily an audio converter, since it’s capable of doing so much more than that. But it earned a spot on this list anyway because it has audio converting features! We recommend this for users who want an ‘All-in-One’ tool! One that will not only allow them to convert a variety of audio but also give them the ability to protect their projects with advanced video editing functions.</p>

<p>For the next item on our list, we have EaseUs Video Converter! If Filmora Pro is the jack of all trades, EaseUs Video Converter is the master of its trade. As a converter true and true, it is capable of more advanced conversions. Case in point, the software supports over 300 audio formats (including some of the obscure ones!) It also offers basic video and audio editing for perfecting projects!</p>

<p>A majority of the <strong>audio converter</strong> software that we’ve introduced has mainly been for Windows users! That is why, for this fifth audio converter, we’ve specifically picked one that is compatible with Mac OS and Windows! As you can see from the image provided, MediaHuman is a very simple and clean audio converter. That makes it incredibly easy to use, and quite convenient to just pick up.</p>

There are just too many of them! No one has the time to go and test each and every single one of them! (Aside from us!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Fortunately, in terms of features, there are really only three that you have to think about: speed, flexibility, and bonus features.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The abundance of choices at least makes sure that each <strong>audio auditor</strong> is able to meet the specific needs of a certain group of users! To imitate this fact, our list of <strong>audio converters</strong> was compiled specifically so that we could offer as much variety as possible. With hints along the way to make sure that everyone has an audio converter that suits their own projects.</p>
