<p><strong>Pixel aspect ratio:</strong></p>
<p>Pixels are several tiny squares that build up an image in a video. Whereas, aspect ratio refers to the ratio of width to height of a video. Hence, the pixel aspect ratio (PAR) is the ratio of width to height of the pixels.</p>

                ></p>
<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

                ></p>
<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

                ></p>
<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

                ></p>
<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions.

<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article-4"><a href="#In-this-article-4" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 [Why Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 1)</p>
<p>02 [How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?](#Part 2)</p>
<p>03 [How to Convert M4A to M4R?](#Part 3)</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R"><a href="#Part-1-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 Why Convert MP3 to M4R?"></a>Part 1 <strong>Why Convert MP3 to M4R?</strong></h2><p>Let’s start with a bit of an overview of M4R and <strong>M4R Converter</strong>s first! We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-Mp3-to-M4R"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-Mp3-to-M4R" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?</strong></h2><p>Now, let’s start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we’ll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?"></a>01<strong>How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned, the first <strong>M4R Converter</strong> on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we’ll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you’re curious, the tool we’ll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!</strong></p>
<p>First! Open the <strong>M4R Converter online</strong> tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%203.png"
                      alt="Open M4R Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload MP3 File for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select M4R as Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Select Convert!</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to simply select the ‘CONVERT’ option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select Convert Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download Converter M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click ‘DOWNLOAD’ and you’re done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%209.png"
                      alt="Adjust Ringtone Timing"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2010.png"
                      alt="Create Version of MP3"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>

                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Locally or Through Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2015.png"
                      alt="Browse Music File Locally"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Browse Music on Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Software Library Upload"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> simply by rewriting the file extension name.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload M4A File!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve been moved to the free <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> converter, select the ‘UPLOAD M4A’ option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using the <strong>M4A to M4R Converter</strong> you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen ‘M4R’ as your desired conversion format!</p>

In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the ‘Create Version’ feature that iTunes offers.</p>
<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

Well, it’s most relevant to iOS users! Especially those who are tired of listening to the same boring tones on their phone over and over again!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The M4R file format was created by Apple to differentiate music from ringtones. And, by becoming familiar with the process (which we’ve illustrated in many details in the article above), you can flex your creativity a bit and control just what tones are coming out of your phone!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>

<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>

We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-1"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-1" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-1"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-1" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Convert-Mp3-to-M4R-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Convert-Mp3-to-M4R-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?"></a>Part 2 <strong>How to Convert Mp3 to M4R?</strong></h2><p>Now, let’s start with a more in-depth tutorial on how to actually convert MP3 to M4R! In this case, specifically, we’ll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-1"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-1" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?"></a>01<strong>How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned, the first <strong>M4R Converter</strong> on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we’ll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you’re curious, the tool we’ll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!</strong></p>
<p>First! Open the <strong>M4R Converter online</strong> tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Open M4R Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload MP3 File for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Select Convert!</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to simply select the ‘CONVERT’ option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Select Convert Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download Converter M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click ‘DOWNLOAD’ and you’re done!</p>
<p><img

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Ringtone Timing"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Version of MP3"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>

How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?"></a>01<strong>3. How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?</strong></h3><p>For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we’ve decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we’ll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!</strong></p>
<p>First, launch the <strong>M4R converter</strong> software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we’re showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Launch Program and Connect iPhone"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker</strong></p>
<p>Once the program has been launched, go to the ‘MUSIC’ tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2014.png"
                      alt="Upload Locally or Through Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music File Locally"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music on Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/before-you-learn-m4r-converter-some-things-you-should-know%2017.png"
                      alt="Software Library Upload"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

<h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Convert-M4A-to-M4R-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Convert-M4A-to-M4R-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How to Convert M4A to M4R?"></a>Part 3 <strong>How to Convert M4A to M4R?</strong></h2><p>Another Apple extension file that you might recognize is M4A! This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-1"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>

                      alt="View File Extensions on Windows"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Rename M4A to M4R"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> simply by rewriting the file extension name.</p>

<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such <strong>M4A converter</strong> that we recommend is Filmora Pro!</p>

Well, it’s most relevant to iOS users! Especially those who are tired of listening to the same boring tones on their phone over and over again!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The M4R file format was created by Apple to differentiate music from ringtones. And, by becoming familiar with the process (which we’ve illustrated in many details in the article above), you can flex your creativity a bit and control just what tones are coming out of your phone!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>

<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>

We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-2"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-2" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-2"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-2" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>

In this case, specifically, we’ll be providing three different examples. Starting with an online solution and then following it up with the general iTunes conversion and the more involved software conversion!</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-2"><a href="#01How-to-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-Online-2" class="headerlink" title="01How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?"></a>01<strong>How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online?</strong></h3><p>As mentioned, the first <strong>M4R Converter</strong> on this list is an online one! There are plenty of these kinds of online converter tools available, and they all pretty much work the same way, so the example we’ll be showing below is more of an all-purpose kind of affair. However, just in case you’re curious, the tool we’ll be using for our examples is the Converter from Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Visit Online Converter Website!</strong></p>
<p>First! Open the <strong>M4R Converter online</strong> tool that you want to use! If you want to follow along with our examples, a URL has been provided for you below:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Open M4R Converter"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload MP3 File for Conversion"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select M4R as Output Format!</strong></p>
<p>Once your MP3 file has been uploaded, select the format that you want it to be converted into. This may have defaulted to M4R or you may be given the chance to choose yourself (as is shown in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select M4R as Output Format"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Select Convert!</strong></p>
<p>The next thing you need to do is to simply select the ‘CONVERT’ option to begin processing the change from MP3 to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select Convert Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Download Converter M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once the conversion is done, you should now have been given the option to download the finished M4R. Click ‘DOWNLOAD’ and you’re done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Adjust Ringtone Timing"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Create Version of MP3"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?</strong></h3><p>For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we’ve decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we’ll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!</strong></p>
<p>First, launch the <strong>M4R converter</strong> software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we’re showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Launch Program and Connect iPhone"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker</strong></p>
<p>Once the program has been launched, go to the ‘MUSIC’ tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Upload Locally or Through Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Software Library Upload"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-2"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-2" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>Once the  version of the file has been created (which comes out as M4A), you can use the method we showed in Section 3, Part 1 of this article to change the <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> simply by rewriting the file extension name.</p>

Only, this time, we’ll be focusing on converting <strong>M4A to M4R online</strong> with an <strong>M4R converter online</strong>! Specifically, the one we introduced previously — Audio Tool Set!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Online M4R Converter</strong></p>
<p>Audio Tool Set offers an <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> converter that you can select under the ‘CONVERT AUDIO’ tab!</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload M4A File!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve been moved to the free <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> converter, select the ‘UPLOAD M4A’ option to browse your PC for the M4A file that you want to convert.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Confirm M4R Conversion Format!</strong></p>
<p>If you’re using the <strong>M4A to M4R Converter</strong> you can skip this step. But, if not, make sure that you have chosen ‘M4R’ as your desired conversion format!</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 4: Convert M4A to M4R!</strong></p>

                ></p>

In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the ‘Create Version’ feature that iTunes offers.</p>
<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such <strong>M4A converter</strong> that we recommend is Filmora Pro!</p>

<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>

<p>M4R is an audio file extension that was created by Apple to separate regular songs and audio from ringtones</p>
<p>As for methods of converting from your more general file extension formats to M4R, we’ve prepared a whole guide below — where we’ve outlined some of the more important things that you should know about <strong>M4R converters</strong> and how to use them.</p>

We touched upon this subject in the introduction, but we thought it would be best to expand on the subject here for better understanding. First, let’s talk about what an <strong>M4R converter</strong> is usually like. Then, let’s talk about why someone might convert from MP3 to M4R.</p>
<h3 id="01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-3"><a href="#01M4R-Converter-Key-Features-3" class="headerlink" title="01M4R Converter Key Features"></a>01<strong>M4R Converter Key Features</strong></h3><p>Here’s a list of some key features that you should look for in an <strong>M4R Converter</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Your average <strong>M4R Converter</strong> should allow you to convert to M4R from general audio files. That includes the following: MP3, WAV, WMA, AIFF, AMR, FLAC, MKA, WMV, and so much more.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It should also allow you to ‘extract’ audio from videos (whether it is a MPEG-4, MOV, AVI, etc.)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The <strong>M4R</strong> <strong>converter</strong> would prove even more useful if it allowed you to trim small segments of audio or video (with exact start and end time) so that you can specify which part should play as a ringtone.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A method of previewing trimmed content prior to conversion would also be helpful so that you won’t have to undergo the process again and again.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Its settings should also be adjustable or the interface intuitive, allowing you to easily choose or discover the output folder, adjust audio bitrate, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-3"><a href="#02Best-Three-Reasons-Why-Convert-MP3-to-M4R-3" class="headerlink" title="02Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R"></a>02<strong>Best Three Reasons Why Convert MP3 to M4R</strong></h3><p>There are several reasons why you might want to use an <strong>M4R converter</strong> to change from MP3 to M4R, these reasons include:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Creating iPhone Ringtone</strong>: The main purpose of converting to M4R is, of course, to create iPhone ringtones. This file extension was created by Apple specifically to differentiate between songs and ringtones. And, if you’re a regular iOS user but are not a fan of the basic iOS ringtones, learning how to create M4R files would be beneficial in opening your horizons.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Transfer Ringtones to iPhone</strong>: Of course, once the M4R is created for use, it would need to be transferred. This is much easier if it stays in this format!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Making General M4R Audio</strong>: Although not as common, some users see the benefit of using M4R audio for other reasons (i.e., content creators sometimes use M4R audio as a sound-effect for videos). Thus, knowing how to convert from MP3 to MP4 usually proves to be useful for them.</p>

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Upload MP3 File</strong></p>
<p>Next, it’s time to upload the MP3 file that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p>Usually, all you have to do for this is click the ‘Upload’ button or drag-and-drop the file onto the specified area. But, in some cases, the <strong>M4R converter</strong> may also allow you to upload via a link or from cloud-based storage (i.e., Dropbox.)</p>

How to convert MP3 to M4R on iTunes?</strong></h3><p>Of course, as an Apple File Extension, it only makes sense that Apple provides its users an easy way to convert general audio to M4R! In this case, we’ll be showing you another method to convert from MP3 to M4R with Apple’s own iTunes! Of course, if you want to follow along with this next example, you’ll have to download and install the software (for Windows users) before proceeding.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File or Folder to Library!</strong></p>
<p>Once you have iTunes installed, launch the program and go to ‘File’ &gt; ‘Add File to Library’ or ‘Add Folder to Library’ to upload the MP3 file(s) that you want to convert to M4R!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Add MP3 file(s) to iTunes Library"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select MP3 and Adjust Timing!</strong></p>
<p>Since M4R ringtones are limited to 40 seconds only, you’ll need to adjust timing prior to conversion if you want the ringtone to start and end at a specific time.</p>
<p>This is possible to do by selecting the song from your library and right clicking so you can access the ‘OPTIONS’ tab (shown below)! Under the Options tab, you’ll be able to specify the start and stop time for your chosen MP3!</p>
<p>Click ‘OK’ when done in order to save any changes!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Convert to Version!</strong></p>
<p>Next, with the MP3 file still selected, go to the ‘FILE’ tab (shown in the image below) and then click ‘CONVERT’ &gt; ‘Create Version’!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Go to the Destination Folder!</strong></p>
<p>After the conversion has been finished, locate the file’s destination folder. You’ll notice that the file extension of the file is .M4A but this is easy enough to change.</p>
<p>Just rename the file extension to .M4R (example shown below) and click ‘YES’ to confirm the change! In this way, you’ve managed to convert MP3 to M4R with iTunes!</p>

How to Convert MP3 to M4R Online Free with Ringtone Maker?</strong></h3><p>For this last example of converting MP3 to M4R, we’ve decided to show-off the ringtone maker, Wondershare TunesGo! This program is, of course, more than just a ringtone maker, but the function that we’ll be exploring will be the process of making an iPhone Ringtone from an MP3 file to an M4R (start to finish!)</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Launch Program and Connect iPhone to Computer!</strong></p>
<p>First, launch the <strong>M4R converter</strong> software on your desktop and connect your iPhone to your computer! If you want to use the program that we’re showing off in this example, the URL has been provided below:</p>
<p><img

                      alt="Launch Program and Connect iPhone"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Select Ringtone Maker</strong></p>
<p>Once the program has been launched, go to the ‘MUSIC’ tab and select “Ringtone Maker” (pointed out in the image below.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Select ‘Ringtone Maker’ Option"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Select Music File!</strong></p>
<p>A secondary window should appear after you select the ‘Ringtone Maker’ option. Here, the first thing you have to do is upload the music file that you want to convert.</p>
<p>For the software that we’re using as an example, you can choose to upload ‘Local Music’ from your computer or ‘Device Music’ from the music that you have stored in your connected iPhone. We’ll be explaining the different methods to select a music file in the three following steps!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Upload Locally or Through Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 4: Local Upload - Open!</strong></p>
<p>If you select ‘Local Music’ a system window will appear asking you to select the music file that you want to convert to M4R. Do so and click ‘OPEN!’</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music File Locally"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 5: Device Music - SELECT!</strong></p>
<p>For the ‘Device Music’ option, another program window will appear. This time, with all the music on your device. You can select the music file you want to convert from here! Click ‘Select’ when done!</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Browse Music on Device"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 6: TunesGo Library!</strong></p>
<p>For the last method of selecting a music file, all you have to do is select a file from the ‘MUSIC’ tab of TunesGo, right-click on said file, and then select ‘Ringtone Maker’ on the pop-up that appears (shown below).</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Software Library Upload"
                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 7: Trim and Save!</strong></p>
<p>Once you’ve chosen the music file you want to convert, you can now:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Trim the file to specify which part of the file you want to convert (40 seconds only for a proper Ringtone!)</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> Use the ‘Ringtone Audition’ option to preview your trimmed audio.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, finally, you can save the finished ringtone directly to your PC or Device!</p>
<p>In this way, not only have you managed to convert from MP3 to M4R cleanly, but you can also use it right away on either your PC or iPhone!</p>

This was mentioned briefly in a previous tutorial, but it might be more familiar to others as ‘compressed’ Apple Music. This is what your audio becomes when processed through iTunes. It’s also known as MPEG-4 Audio, and its main purpose is to compress the size of an audio file (compared to MP3) without compromising the quality.</p>
<h3 id="01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-3"><a href="#01How-to-convert-M4A-to-M4R-on-Windows-3" class="headerlink" title="01How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?"></a>01<strong>How to convert M4A to M4R on Windows?</strong></h3><p>This process was mentioned briefly in Part 2, Section 3 of this article, but we’ll be going through the easiest method of converting <strong>M4A to M4R</strong> on Windows below! This method is possible only because the formats are pretty much the same. The only difference lies in how they are categorized.</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: View File Extensions!</strong></p>
<p>The first step to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> is to open the folder in which your M4A audio is stored. There, make sure that you have ‘File Name Extensions’ selected under the ‘VIEW’ tab (pointed out in the image below).</p>
<p>This will allow you to view and edit the file extension of a given file.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 2: Rename M4A to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Next, select the M4A that you want to convert and right-click so that you can choose the ‘Rename’ option on the pop-up that appears.</p>

                ></p>
<p>**<strong>Step 3: Change M4A to M4R</strong></p>
<p>With ‘File Name Extensions’ on, you can edit the file extension as well! Of course, this is not possible for all conversions. But, as mentioned, since M4A and M4R files are pretty much the same, you can do so without damaging the file!</p>
<p>Meaning, you can <strong>change M4A to M4R</strong> without worrying about it being unusable!</p>

How to Convert M4A to M4R with iTunes</strong></h3><p>This process was already explained in Part 2, Section 2 of this article. But, since it’s important to provide this perspective we’ll be going through the process again. This time, with the intention of converting an M4A music file to an M4R!</p>
<p>**<strong>Step 1: Add File to iTunes Library!</strong></p>
<p>First, add the M4A file to your iTunes library! (You can use the drag-and-drop feature or select ‘Add File’ or ‘Add folder’ under the ‘FILE’ tab).</p>
<p><img

<p>**<strong>Step 2: Create to M4R!</strong></p>
<p>Once your M4A audio file has been uploaded, make sure that it’s selected and then select ‘Create Version’ for it (the option can be found under the ‘FILE’ tab &gt; ‘Convert’!)</p>
<p><img

In both sections, we demonstrated how one can create an M4A file by using the ‘Create Version’ feature that iTunes offers.</p>
<p>In that same vein, if you want to be able to open an M4A file, iTunes is your best bet! Although, it should also be said that some of the more advanced media players (and audio players), like QuickTime or Media Player, can open M4A files as well!</p>

If you want examples: you can <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong>, MP3 to M4A, WAV to M4A, FLAC to M4A, OGG to M4A, WMA to M4A, and so much more! Of course, if you want more advanced M4A conversions, you might want to consider using a more advanced tool. One such <strong>M4A converter</strong> that we recommend is Filmora Pro!</p>
<p><strong><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora Video Editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></strong> is an all-in-one video editing software that will allow you to <strong>convert M4A to M4R</strong> (and all sorts of other audio and video file formats) so that you can make use of the file for all your projects! The best part of using a video editor like Filmora, of course, is that once you’ve converted the file, you can use it immediately — there’s no need to wait, you can finish your project right then and there, making it unnecessary for you to go searching for any other solution.</p>

<h2 id="Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3"><a href="#Key-Takeaways-from-This-Episode-3" class="headerlink" title="Key Takeaways from This Episode"></a>Key Takeaways from This Episode</h2><p><strong>●</strong> What’s the point of <strong>M4R Converter</strong>s? Well, it’s most relevant to iOS users! Especially those who are tired of listening to the same boring tones on their phone over and over again!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> The M4R file format was created by Apple to differentiate music from ringtones. And, by becoming familiar with the process (which we’ve illustrated in many details in the article above), you can flex your creativity a bit and control just what tones are coming out of your phone!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> It’s not all that difficult to create M4Rs either! There are several methods that you can try — online, iTunes, third-party software, and so much more!</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> And, you can make these ringtones from pretty much any format — whether you’re converting from MP3, MOV, WAV, FLAC, WMA, etc.</p>
