</ul>
<p>Among the many reasons for plugin malfunction, one of the most common ones in incorrect or bad code.

<li><strong>Placement of the Effects and Transitions</strong> - While placing your titles and generators, you should ensure that they go on the top of your timeline however the transitions can go in between the two clips on the timeline and the effects can be dropped directly into the video clip.</li>
<li><strong>Delete the Plugin from Everywhere</strong> - You should always consider deleting the plugin from everywhere in your system if it continues to trouble you. Delete it from the finder and trash folders, then re-download, re-install and restart your system.</li>
<li><strong>Seek Help from the Plugin Creator</strong> - If none of the aforementioned tips helps, you should definitely turn to the service provider or the plugin creator who can offer you their expert assistance.</li>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io"><a href="#2-Veed-io" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic"><a href="#3-Lunapic" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-lunapic.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>

Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>

<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>

<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>

Users can edit the speed on existing GIFs or can create new collages with multiple GIFs, benefitting from added animation and colour and visual effects without losing the quality of the original imagery or footage.</p>
<h4 id="GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-1"><a href="#GIF-Speed-Changer-FAQ-1" class="headerlink" title="GIF Speed Changer FAQ"></a>GIF Speed Changer FAQ</h4><p><strong>Can I slow down a GIF?</strong></p>
<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-2"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-2" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>

                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-2"><a href="#2-Veed-io-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-2"><a href="#3-Lunapic-2" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-2"><a href="#4-GifGit-2" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-2"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-2" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

<p>In short, yes. How you do this will depend on the platform you use, however for the most part, any platform which allows the GIF to be sped up will also allow you to slow it down.</p>
<p><strong>How do you change the speed of a GIF in PowerPoint?</strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately, there is no tool within PowerPoint that allows users to adjust the speed of an external GIF. The small animations and movements of images and words created and controlled within PowerPoint can be adjusted in the settings of each animation tool – however, at present, GIFs themselves are unable to be altered in PowerPoint itself.</p>
<p><strong>How do you make a GIF 30fps?</strong></p>
<p>This number refers to the frame control time, with most computer displays running at around 60fps. To adjust this number to 30fps, the user will need to enter the settings of the GIF and set the run time at 30 for a delay of 0.03 seconds on each frame.</p>
<p><strong>Why is frame rate important in GIF animation and how do you change frame rate in GIF exportation?</strong></p>
<p>Frame rate comes into play when watching back the GIF as a piece of complete footage – with frame rate affecting the overall smooth transition of the GIF from frame to frame and back to the beginning. If your frame rate isn’t controlled, the finish will be jumpy and won’t look good. When you move to convert and export your GIF, you will have an option to adjust the loop setting and timeline setting – as well as the frames per second. Setting this at 30 will provide you with a seamless and consistently high quality finish – perfect for your brand new GIF.</p>

<p>The world is shifting, with more and more businesses and companies using online imagery and video content as a means of reaching their target audience and demographic wherever they may be - and GIF’s represent one of the biggest growing trends of the decade.</p>
<p>But not all GIF’s are perfect. Some react far too quickly, while some are very slow and clunky in their movement – with video editors and animators finding that simply changing the speed of a GIF can have a huge impact on the way it is viewed and used by consumers.</p>

<h3 id="1-EZGIF-com-3"><a href="#1-EZGIF-com-3" class="headerlink" title="1. EZGIF.com"></a>1. EZGIF.com</h3><p>This online GIF speed editor offers all the usability of a basic Windows image or video editing program, but with all the technological expertise of a modern video editor. GIF’s can be edited as GIF’s or as MP4 files, and though the site takes a while to download the completed files, the end result is high in quality and creates a seamless pattern of movement. Other features include:</p>
<ul>
<li>No registration is required and there is no user limit – this really is a free editing site</li>
<li>Colour editing and text overlay can be instantly added to any GIF footage</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-ezgif.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in EZgif"
                ></p>
<p>To change the speed of your GIF using EzGIF, visit this page <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://ezgif.com/speed" >https://ezgif.com/speed <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<p>Once your GIF is uploaded to the free-to-use site, you can alter the percentage of current speed using a basic drop down – something which should always be altered based on the idea of 100% representing the original speed. Changing the percentage to 200% will make the GIF run 2x faster, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="2-Veed-io-3"><a href="#2-Veed-io-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Veed.io"></a>2. Veed.io</h3><p>This site, found at <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer" >https://www.veed.io/tools/gif-speed-changer <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is a great way of editing your GIF speed quickly and easily – using just a few basic steps. Once users have arrived on the site and clicked on the big blue ‘Get Started’ button, they will find themselves faced with a very simple upload tool.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-gif-speed-with-veed.jpg"
                      alt="change gif speed in Veed.io"
                ></p>
<p>From there the size, speed and colouring can be altered on their GIF, with the ability to add music also available. Changing the speed can be done using a selection of pre-programmed buttons – ranging from 0.5x (half the original speed) up to 2x (double the original speed). Users can also select the custom speed button and play around with a speed of their own making.</p>
<h3 id="3-Lunapic-3"><a href="#3-Lunapic-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Lunapic"></a>3. Lunapic</h3><p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="change gif speed in Lunapic"
                ></p>
<p>What we like about Lunapic is the way that the site allows us to change not only the GIF speed but also the order in which different images and visuals are presented – giving the user a chance to upload new content to add into their GIF or else simply adjust the speed and timing delay on the original clip. Users can add animation to certain aspects and parts of the video or image and can set the looping option of their GIF to start and end at any point – altering the way the end consumer views the starting image. The speeds included on the site may be determined in advance giving you a limited choice, but the range available means this isn’t too much of a problem.</p>
<h3 id="4-GifGit-3"><a href="#4-GifGit-3" class="headerlink" title="4. GifGit"></a>4. GifGit</h3><p><img

                      alt="change gif speed in GifGit"
                ></p>
<p>Cheesy website names aside, this online tool is super easy to use with a very basic user interface. Found through this site - <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit" >https://www.gifgit.com/gif/edit <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> - editing GIF’s is a simple case of uploading the GIF clip and using the Delay tool as a way of setting the speed using the delay of milliseconds on each frame. This number, in the example sitting at 80, refers to the number of milliseconds that will be spent on each frame of the GIF – with a lower number enabling the GIF to move faster while a larger delay number will make your GIF play much slower.</p>
<p>This site is good if you’re happy to experiment with a little trial and error!</p>
<h3 id="5-IMG-Flip-3"><a href="#5-IMG-Flip-3" class="headerlink" title="5. IMG Flip"></a>5. IMG Flip</h3><p>As with many online tools, this site does come with limitations – however, in our opinion the vast range of customisable options and editing features outweigh the fact that your GIF’s can only be stored up to 4MB before you have to start paying. For the most part, this is a site which is ideal for those who are simply looking to edit one or two GIF’s – if you’re looking to make a habit of it, then you would be best looking at one of the other sites which offers more in terms of storage and free uses.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

To change the speed you simply need upload your clip and then adjust the speed as a percentage of the original clip – 100% being the starting point, with 200% running the GIF at twice the speed and 50% running it at half speed.</p>

<p>We start with a simple one which can be found on the app store using any search for a GIF app. This particular app plays on the concept of building your own memes, giving users a chance to enhance their own comic value on platforms like WhatsApp and Facebook using their own images or multiple GIF’s strung together. We particularly love the fact that ImgPlay’s platform allows users to add their own text and emojis over the top of the visuals, completely personalising the end product and creating something which is unique for their own use. A simple slider tool allows for easy editing of the GIF speed, presenting an all-round great tool for beginners and experience GIF makers alike.</p>

<p>The Imgur app is one of the most popular GIF creation tools out there – offering users with a platform which allows them edit as many GIFs as they like, play with the speed of existing and new GIFs, and share their creations with other users who can share your designs and help you go viral. As much an online community as a GIF editing tool, Imgur could well be the new Instagram – if Instagram suddenly decided to wave goodbye to the influencers and adverts and make way for user built content and humorous motion videos instead!</p>

<p>This is a tool which supports the creation of GIFs using actions and movements which you capture on camera straight into the app. Opening the app, you simply select the camera feature and capture the movement or motion – before diving into the editing of speed, colour, appearance and overlays.

<p>Photo Collage Maker lets you choose from more than <strong>250 photo collage templates</strong> that are suitable for virtually any purpose. The number of pictures you can include in a photo collage can vary from just <strong>two to more than 75</strong> and it depends on the template you choose. You can also automatically desaturate all the images in a photo collage by clicking on the <strong>B&amp;W&#x2F;Color icon</strong> or <strong>change the background</strong> with a single click. Photo Collage Maker doesn’t offer any border options, so you can’t really control the spacing between the images. Downloading a 1-megapixel file from this platform is going to cost you $5.56.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.</p>
<h4 id="DEFINITIONS"><a href="#DEFINITIONS" class="headerlink" title="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h4><p>Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.</li>
<li>Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called “supers” or “keys.”</li>
<li>Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.</li>
<li>Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the “lower-third” of the screen.</li>
<li>Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to introduce “Yertle,” he’s a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)</p>
<p>At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I’ll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.</p>
<p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p>
<p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p>
<p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p>
<p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p>

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I’ve added a few custom titles to my system.)</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Let’s add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’m using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others… You can delete this title now.</p>
<p>So, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add titles using keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Drag titles from the Title Browser</li>
<li>Change position by dragging the title</li>
<li>Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip</li>
<li>Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key</li>

                ></p>
<p>Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I’ve changed my title to “An Undersea Adventure.”</p>
<p>NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I’ll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.</p>
<p>All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.</p>
<h4 id="FORMATTING-TEXT"><a href="#FORMATTING-TEXT" class="headerlink" title="FORMATTING TEXT"></a>FORMATTING TEXT</h4><p><img

                ></p>
<p>You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.</p>
<p>Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.</p>
<p>NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you want a fast way to format text, click the word “Normal” at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment… all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I’ve changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.</p>
<p>While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.</li>
<li>Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.</li>
<li>Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>
<p>While much of today’s video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.</p>
<p>Titles015</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select “Show Action Safe&#x2F;Title Safe Zones.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called “Action Safe,” the inner one is called “Title Safe.” Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.</p>
<p>When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.</p>
<p>Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY"><a href="#SUMMARY" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what’s going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.</p>
<h4 id="DEFINITIONS-1"><a href="#DEFINITIONS-1" class="headerlink" title="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h4><p>Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.</li>
<li>Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called “supers” or “keys.”</li>
<li>Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.</li>
<li>Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the “lower-third” of the screen.</li>
<li>Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’d like to introduce “Yertle,” he’s a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)</p>
<p>At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I’ll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.</p>
<p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p>
<p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p>
<p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p>
<p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-1"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-1" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>
<p>While much of today’s video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called “Action Safe,” the inner one is called “Title Safe.” Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.</p>
<p>When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.</p>
<p>Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-1"><a href="#SUMMARY-1" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what’s going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro X has almost 200 different text effects that we can add, but the process of adding titles is essentially the same. Adding titles is what this article is about.</p>
<h4 id="DEFINITIONS-2"><a href="#DEFINITIONS-2" class="headerlink" title="DEFINITIONS"></a>DEFINITIONS</h4><p>Just to keep us all on the same page, here are my definitions of key terms related to text:</p>
<ul>
<li>Text or titles. Words placed on the screen. I use these terms interchangeably.</li>
<li>Superimpose. Text displayed on the the screen with other video below it. These are also called “supers” or “keys.”</li>
<li>Full-screen. Text which occupies the entire screen.</li>
<li>Lower-third. Text which fits below a person talking; in the “lower-third” of the screen.</li>
<li>Info-graphics. Full-screen text which is superimposed on a graphic, generally used to convey technical information. Typical uses are sports statistics or other information which is easier to convey using text than having someone read the words.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="JUST-THE-BASICS-2"><a href="#JUST-THE-BASICS-2" class="headerlink" title="JUST THE BASICS"></a>JUST THE BASICS</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles001.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>I’d like to introduce “Yertle,” he’s a sea turtle and the star of this article. (Footage courtesy of Jim Walker and Lobsters Gone Wild Productions.)</p>
<p>At its simplest, we use titles to display his (its?) name.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles002.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>In the Timeline, put the playhead where you want a title to appear and type Shift+Control+T. This inserts the default lower-third title at the position of the playhead. The title, like almost all titles, has a default duration of 10:00 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles003.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Look at the Browser and see the results of your work. A lower-third title is superimposed over the video in the lower left corner. (I’ll talk about formatting the text in a few paragraphs.)</p>
<p>NOTE: The big limitation of this lower-third title is that it can only be positioned in the left corner. Moving it to the center or right corner requires manual adjustment.</p>
<p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p>
<p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p>
<p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p>
<p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I’ve added a few custom titles to my system.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’m using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others… You can delete this title now.</p>
<p>So, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add titles using keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Drag titles from the Title Browser</li>
<li>Change position by dragging the title</li>
<li>Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip</li>
<li>Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="CHANGING-TEXT-2"><a href="#CHANGING-TEXT-2" class="headerlink" title="CHANGING TEXT"></a>CHANGING TEXT</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I’ve changed my title to “An Undersea Adventure.”</p>
<p>NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I’ll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.</p>
<p>All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.</p>
<h4 id="FORMATTING-TEXT-2"><a href="#FORMATTING-TEXT-2" class="headerlink" title="FORMATTING TEXT"></a>FORMATTING TEXT</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.</p>
<p>Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.</p>
<p>NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you want a fast way to format text, click the word “Normal” at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment… all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I’ve changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.</p>
<p>While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.</li>
<li>Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.</li>
<li>Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-2"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-2" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>

<p>You position or trim a title the same as any video clip: drag the clip to a different location, or drag an edge to change its duration.</p>
<p>Select that title and delete it by pressing the Delete key.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles004.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This time, type Control+T and the default full-screen title appears in the center of the screen. Again, this has a default duration of 10 seconds.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles005.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you look right in the center of the screen, you’ll see the word “Title.” Yes, its darn near invisible. And, yes, it looks, um, ugly. However, we have a TON of formatting control to make this look however we want.</p>
<p>Select and delete that full-screen title.</p>
<p>There’s one more way to apply a title: dragging from the Titles Browser.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles006.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Title icon in the Toolbar. This displays the contents of the Title Browser. The column on the left displays title categories, the icons on the right indicate individual titles, the search box at the bottom allows you to search for specific titles by name, while the number in the lower right indicates the number of titles currently displayed. (Your number may not match mine because I’ve added a few custom titles to my system.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles007.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Let’s add a totally ridiculous title to our turtle - drag Clouds from the Title Browser and place it above the clip at the point where you want a title to appear.</p>
<p>NOTE: I’m using a marker in the Timeline to help me find the same place in a clip so my screen shots are consistent. Markers are not needed in any way for titles.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles008.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Um, yeah. So, some titles look more professional than others… You can delete this title now.</p>
<p>So, we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Add titles using keyboard shortcuts</li>
<li>Drag titles from the Title Browser</li>
<li>Change position by dragging the title</li>
<li>Change duration by dragging the edge of the clip</li>
<li>Delete a title by selecting it and pressing the Delete key</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="CHANGING-TEXT-3"><a href="#CHANGING-TEXT-3" class="headerlink" title="CHANGING TEXT"></a>CHANGING TEXT</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles009.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Add a new full-screen title (type Control+T) to the Timeline. To change the text in a title, double-click it in the Viewer. Here, I’ve changed my title to “An Undersea Adventure.”</p>
<p>NOTE: We can also change the text using the Inspector. I’ll show you how in a few paragraphs. Pick whichever method is easiest for you.</p>
<p>All text, in any title, can be changed by double-clicking it in the Viewer to select it, then typing the new text you want to use.</p>
<h4 id="FORMATTING-TEXT-3"><a href="#FORMATTING-TEXT-3" class="headerlink" title="FORMATTING TEXT"></a>FORMATTING TEXT</h4><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>You can format any text that you can select. This means that you can format entire phrases, words, or individual letters differently. For this article, I will format everything the same, because once you know how this works, you can experiment on your own.</p>
<p>Here, I selected my entire title and opened the Inspector (shortcut Cmd+4). Click the Text tab at the top. This section of the Inspector allows you to format the text.</p>
<p>NOTE: The text box near the top of the panel is the second place you can select text for formatting.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles011.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>If you want a fast way to format text, click the word “Normal” at the top. This displays a menu filled with different text formats. Some of these formats look pretty dreadful; the rest look worse.</p>
<p>NOTE: You can create your own text styles. Refer to the Help for information on how.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles012.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Basic section of the Inspector allows you to change fonts, size, alignment… all the standard font settings we see in other programs. Here, I’ve changed the font to Hobo Std, at 167 points.</p>
<p>While many of these settings you already know there are a few you may not:</p>
<ul>
<li>Line spacing. Adjusts the vertical distance between lines within the same paragraph.</li>
<li>Tracking. Adjusts the horizontal spacing between letters.</li>
<li>Baseline. Adjusts the vertical spacing of text compared to the horizontal line running thru the center of the white circle in the Viewer.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles013.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>The Face section allows us to change font color, opacity and blue. Outline and Glow allows us to add, not surprisingly, outlines and glows. You can adjust these as you see fit - I tend not to add outlines or glows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles017.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>However, I STRONGLY recommend adding drop shadows to all text that you want viewers to read. Video, even HD video, is low resolution compared to print. Drop shadows make your text much easier to read. These are the settings I recommend for drop shadows.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles014.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>After making a few changes in the Inspector, here’s the final result. Very cool - and very different from where we started!</p>
<h4 id="ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-3"><a href="#ACTION-SAFE-TITLE-SAFE-ZONES-3" class="headerlink" title="ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES"></a>ACTION SAFE&#x2F;TITLE SAFE ZONES</h4><p>Since television was first invented, we needed to compensate for the differences in TV sets by designing graphics to stay within Action Safe and Title Safe boundaries.</p>
<p>While much of today’s video is designed for the web, your titles will look the best if you follow the same guidelines.</p>
<p>Titles015</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles015.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>Go to the Switch in the Viewer and select “Show Action Safe&#x2F;Title Safe Zones.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/titles016.jpg"
                      alt="remote"
                ></p>
<p>This displays two pale rectangles in the frame. The outer rectangle is called “Action Safe,” the inner one is called “Title Safe.” Action Safe is 5% in from all edges; Title Safe is 10% in from all edges.</p>
<p>When designing text and graphics for the web, keep all essential elements inside the outer rectangle. When designing graphics and text for broadcast or cable, keep all essential elements inside the inner rectangle.</p>
<p>Here, for example, notice that my title is fully contained within Action Safe.</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-3"><a href="#SUMMARY-3" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Titles give our programs character and personality, plus they explain what’s going on to the audience. Final Cut Pro X provides a wealth of formatting options to make our text look great.</p>
