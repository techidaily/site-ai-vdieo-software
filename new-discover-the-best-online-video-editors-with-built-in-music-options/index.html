<h2 id="Why-You-Should-Use-Video-Hosting-Service"><a href="#Why-You-Should-Use-Video-Hosting-Service" class="headerlink" title="Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?"></a>Why You Should Use Video Hosting Service?</h2><p>If you intend to host videos on your website, prepare for a myriad of challenges. Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>

<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>
<p>Among the video hosting sites here, this site is less restrictive and easy to share videos to the social media channels. Categorization of the videos offers easy access to ones desired videos.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans. They include the Pro at $19&#x2F;Month and come with 20 embedded videos, Starter at $150&#x2F;Month, Plus at $850&#x2F;Month and Enterprise at an unspecified amount.</p>

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>

<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>

<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>

<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.</p>
<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-1"><a href="#Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms"></a>Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms</h2><p>A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming.

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>
<p>Among the video hosting sites here, this site is less restrictive and easy to share videos to the social media channels. Categorization of the videos offers easy access to ones desired videos.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

Hosting videos on one’s website has never been a story worth telling. Among the challenges faced include video not playing on mobile phones, website not opening, degraded website speed, video opening, and closing.</p>
<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>

<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>

<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>

<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

<p>These are the reasons why people use video hosting sites like YouTube.</p>
<p>Video hosting platforms keep video codes in a concealed manner which makes it difficult for anyone to decode. This bars those intending to use the video codes to download the video and use it to their advantage.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To avoid file format hurdle</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>To host a video on a website, the majority of viewers will encounter viewing problems. Different web browsers accept different file formats. For your video to be viewed across all major browsers, it has to be published in many formats. Converting a video from one format to another is a tedious task.</p>
<p>Online video hosting platforms accepts all the following file formats, MPEG4, MP4, 3GPP , WebM, DNxHR, WMV, MPEGPS and WMV among many others.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Storage Space and File Size Limitations</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>How much space are you allowed to use according to your subscription? Web hosting sites offer limited space to website owners. The more you upload videos and back up your files, the more the storage space becomes smaller. To solve this problem, upload videos first to video hosting service providers then, embed it to your website.</p>
<p>It is really difficult to play a self-hosted video that’s above 100MB. Most of the webs hosting providers limit file sizes to 50 MB.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Advantage of the Already Huge Traffic</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>According to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.businessofapps.com/data/youtube-statistics/" >Business of Apps <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, there are 2 billion monthly active YouTube users. All video hosting service providers have an auto video suggestion feature. Your videos will get views courtesy of traffic from other videos. The more it’s viewed, clicked and rated, the better it ranks.</p>
<p>How to rank videos is little known by video creators. Just upload your high-quality videos and watch it become among the top-ranked in your category.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Help Upload High-Quality Video</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Most video streaming hosting platforms allow HD (High Definition) video uploads. High Definition videos occupy small spaces and attract more viewers.</p>
<p>To reduce video hosting expenses, free video hosting sites like Vimeo, Dailymotion, and Wistia would be the most suitable. Before you can make select a site, there are important factors that need to be considered.</p>
<p>Here are the best sites and their features;</p>
<h2 id="Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-3"><a href="#Best-Free-Video-Hosting-Sites-Services-Platforms-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms"></a>Best Free Video Hosting Sites&#x2F;Services&#x2F;Platforms</h2><p>A number of sites have been offering video hosting services for free overwhelming.

<p>Vimeo is an all-round site. It can, therefore, be used as a business and private video hosting site. Three accounts are at anyone’s disposal; free account paid account with plus, Pro, Business and Premium levels and partner account. It’s not as popular as YouTube but is renowned for high-quality videos.</p>
<p>File size and bandwidth are not limited but you can only upload videos of up to 500MB per week. The annual limitation is 25GB. If you want to watch free ad videos, then use the paid accounts. But the good thing with Vimeo is that ads never play between a video.</p>

<p>With over 500hours of video uploaded to YouTube per minute, 5 billion videos watched every day and at least 1.3 billion registered users, we all can bet it the most popular and preferred video hosting platform. YouTube is owned by Google and is the world’s second-ranked social platform with 27.80 Billion monthly visitors.</p>
<p>Not many people like the many ads but to the entrepreneurs, it’s one of the best video hosting sites for business. They promote their businesses and products and also earn from YouTube. This channel analyses videos and shows the number of viewers, social sharing and related videos.</p>
<p>Verify your account and upload videos of any format of up to 128GB. To watch videos free of ads, subscribe for the premium account. As a free unlimited video hosting site, file size and bandwidth are unlimited but videos cannot exceed 15 minutes</p>

<p>Love uploaded videos as often as you can? Then, this video hosting platform is not designed for you. With a bandwidth limited to 500GB and maximum video uploads capped at 25 videos, musicians and comedians are quite disadvantaged.</p>
<p>However, if you want a video hosting site for business, Wistia is the best. To embed videos on your website, Wistia automatically generates the video code for you to copy-paste. All videos uploaded are HD (High Definition) and contain no ads on the paid plans.</p>
<p>While many sites are non-interactive, Wistia allows video creators to interact and track leads using Mailchimp, HubSpot, Marketo and Pardot platforms. You can also engage your viewers on Facebook and Instagram.</p>

                ></p>
<p>With only four main categories- entertainment, news, sports and music, these sites aren’t as inviting as Vimeo or Youtube. Dailymotion isn’t limited to only those four categories, just a little confusion; comedy, fashion, wild game shows and live streaming are also included.</p>
<p>However, if you want to benefit from its huge traffic of 237.30 million monthly visitors, upload videos and autosuggestions will help get thousands of viewers. Dailymotion offers viewers select their favourite while allowing partners to earn from the opportunities. And when using the free version, know each video is limited to 4GB.</p>
<p>Among the video hosting sites here, this site is less restrictive and easy to share videos to the social media channels. Categorization of the videos offers easy access to ones desired videos.</p>

<p>Vidyard is another online video hosting site for business with both free and paid plans.</p>
<p>The major drawback when using the free plan is the limitations on the number of videos to upload. If your website content requires more than 5 embedded videos a month, upgrade to the paid plans.

<h3 id="4-Massless"><a href="#4-Massless" class="headerlink" title="4. Massless"></a>4.

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>

<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website.

You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>

<p>This online portal enables you to create virtual faces by specifying the physical attributes of a character, such as gender, age, hair color, eye color, and much more. You can be as creative as you want to generate a face that appears somewhat like you with the available options. Once a look is generated, you can download and use it as needed.</p>
<p>The steps that are given below explain how you can use Generated Photos’ Faces section to create and download a virtual face:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your favorite web browser and go to the URL given above, and then you will see all free AI-generated photos on this website.</li>

<li>Click your preferred character from the AI-generated faces, and then click <strong>Download</strong> from the page that opens next. Choose your preferred method to sign up, and then sign in to download the virtual face to your PC.</li>

<p>Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click <strong>Upload photo;</strong></li>
<li>Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.</li>
<li>Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed</li>

<p>This online face generator from Generated Photos allows you to create a unique realt-time face from scratch in one click. And if you don’t like the face generated, you can change the parameters such as gender, skin tone, hair, eye and head pose.</p>
<p>Generated Photos Face Generator tool is a good choice for people who don’t want to upload any photos online, and need to customize the face at maximum.</p>
<p>Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the website give above and then click the <strong>Generate faces</strong></li>

<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Different browsers may have this feature with other names</p>

<p>Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.</p>
<p>However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click <strong>Upload photo;</strong></li>
<li>Select and upload your photo from your PC to the portal and wait while Anonymizer uses AI to generate similar faces.</li>
<li>Click the photo that you want to use, and when the next page opens up, click Sign up or sign in to download the photo and use it wherever needed</li>
</ul>

<p>Below is a brief tutorial about how to generate a face with it step by step:</p>
<ul>

<h3 id="4-Massless-3"><a href="#4-Massless-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Massless"></a>4. Massless</h3><p><strong>Website:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/" >https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.</p>
<p>You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>).</li>
<li>Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., <strong>Nose</strong>), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.</li>
<li>Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Download images</strong> from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.</li>
</ul>

<p>This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.</p>
<p>You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;</li>
<li>Click <strong>Another</strong> from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save image</strong> from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Different browsers may have this feature with other names</p>

<p>This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.</p>
<p>You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click <strong>Generate Another Fake Human</strong> if you don’t like the one that appears;</li>
<li>Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the <strong>Generate A Human</strong> button to create a less realistic image of a random person.</li>
</ul>

<p>faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.</p>
<p>You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click <strong>Start</strong> from the main page.</li>
<li>Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Start</strong> and then click <strong>Continue</strong> on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>With all the cybercrime reports circulating everywhere nowadays, it is important to stay cautious about what you post on any social media website. To add an extra layer of security, you can avoid using your real photograph as a profile picture, and go with the fake faces instead. You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.</p>
