If your highlight video is about a conference, it is essential to know when speakers will deliver the speech, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Make a list of shots</strong></p>
<p>Next, have a list of parts that you wish to capture so that you are more organized at the event. You can’t predict each moment but being ready will help you capture memorable moments.</p>
<p><strong>Use the right equipment</strong></p>
<p>You need to use proper equipment for the events to ensure the footage looks great in low light. Gather all your equipment before the event and make sure it is fully charged and functional. Carry the extra batteries and other tools as well.</p>
