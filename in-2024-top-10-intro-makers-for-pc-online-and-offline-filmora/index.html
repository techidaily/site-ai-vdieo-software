<p>This is probably one of the oldest if not the oldest video editing software for PCs. Microsoft has announced that Windows Movie Maker will no longer be available for download. This software can still be found online, although not on Microsoft’s website, and currently, there are two different versions of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> available. Even the least experienced video editors can master each of the Movie Maker versions easily.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The classic video editing software is equipped with all the tools you’ll need for basic editing tasks like trimming, changing the video playback speed or rotating videos. It even features a Video Stabilization option that can be useful if you’d like to stabilize a video and remove the distracting camera shakes. Windows Movie Maker lets you add text effects to your video, insert Transitions between two takes, perform basic audio editing or record a screen.</p>

<p>As the Apple’s version of the Windows Movie Maker, iMovie has a similar status of a classic video editor that is at its best when used for simple video editing tasks. The video editor can also be used on an iPhone or an iPad if you want to edit your videos on the go. Learning your way around iMovie won’t take much of your time since all of its features are easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Editing 4K videos or making credits or titles are just a few among many options provided by iMovie. Adding transitions, applying split-screen effects or creating PIP videos doesn’t require you to be a skilled video editor, because all of these options are easily accessible and they can be used in any project you are working on.</p>
<p>The iMovie’s audio editing options are equally impressive since the software enables you to add music, use built-in sound effects and record voiceovers. The video editor supports most of the popular file formats.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro is probably one of the highest praised video editing software ever created. It has been used to edit cinematic masterpieces such as ‘What happened Miss Simone’ or ‘The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo’, which speaks volumes about the software’s capability. Final Cut Pro’s Magnetic Timeline 2 is one of the kind, and it makes organizing large amounts of video and audio files look easy. Although the software’s price may seem discouraging, those who invested in it never had to use another video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> A brief look at the list of Final Cut Pro’s video editing tools will leave you wondering if there is anything this software can’t do. Besides basic video editing features, the video editor is also equipped with 360 degrees VR video editing option, Multicam editing, and advanced color grading tools. Final Cut Pro allows its users to add as many audio tracks to the timeline as they want, thus enabling them to create impeccable soundtracks for their videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Working with large numbers of video files is simplified by the software’s timeline, while options such as 3D titles or VR contribute to the strong impression this editor leaves on all of its users.</p>

<p>Lightworks is one of the best video editing software on this list with a long history in the movie-making business. The free version of the software is available, but it has limited export options. A $25 monthly subscription is required in order to gain access to all of the software’s features. Although it may be a somewhat pricey option, purchasing Lightworks is a profitable investment that may help you improve the quality of your videos.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Both free and paid versions of this video editing suite offer support for wide range of video file formats. This can be very useful for video editors who often work on projects shot on different cameras. Multi-cam editing feature enables the software’s users to work with footage shot from separate angles, using more than just one camera. The videos edited with the free version of the software can only be exported to an MPEG4 file format with the maximum size of 1280X 790 pixels, and they must be uploaded to YouTube directly from the editor.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Royalty-free media and a remarkable VFX panel make Lightworks a tempting option for professional and amateur video editors alike.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The export options on the free version of the software are extremely limited and the software doesn’t provide much support for inexperienced users.</p>

The software supports 2D and 3D effects compositing, as well as 4K and 360-degree videos.</p>
<p>HitFilm Express’ titling options are at the basic level, while its Export options are alarmingly narrow. This free editing software doesn’t provide too many options for color adjustments, but its audio editing features can be used to create a video with a superior soundtrack.</p>

<p>Blender started out as an open-source project and over the years animators, scientists, VFX artists and numerous other people have participated in developing this 3D creation suite. The software can be used for modeling, animation, video editing or compositing, to mention only a few of its many purposes. Editing video footage isn’t Blender’s strong suit, but its video editing features are powerful enough to enable you to perform basic editing tasks. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t use this software to create videos that grab the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Cutting or trimming videos, adjusting the video’s playback speed or adding keyframes to a video clip is an easy process in Blender. The software’s true strength lies in its animation, 3D modeling or motion tracking features. The latest version of Blender is equipped with a motion tracking option that allows you to import the footage into the software directly from a camera. You can utilize this feature to mask areas of the shot and see the movement on camera in a 3D environment.</p>

<p>This simple video editing software has all the tools you’ll ever need to quickly polish your videos. Its audio and video effects can be utilized to make your videos look and sound professionally, but Avidemux doesn’t offer much more than these basic video editing options.</p>

<p>VideoPad is one of the best entry-level cross-platform software products you can use for easy video editing tasks. The free version of the software is available to both Mac and PC users, although the Windows version limits the video exporting options to just two file formats. The VideoPad’s interface doesn’t take much time to get used to, and it perfectly adjusted to the needs of inexperienced video editors. Paid versions of the software are available to advanced editors who want to use VideoPad for more than just basic video editing.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The list of video editing features VideoPad provides includes several pleasant surprises. The 4K video support, as well as 360-video editing features, are aimed at GoPro owners who want a quick and easy way to process their footage. The visual effects this free video editing software provides are impressive, while the Chroma Key option enables its users to create green screen videos. Even though VideoPad allows its users to edit audio files, its audio editing features are fairly modest.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Learning how to use VideoPad is simplified by its intuitively designed interface.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There are no advanced video editing options like multi-cam editing and motion tracking and certain features become unavailable when using the free version of the software over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>This award-winning open-source video editor offers a wide range of video editing tools that span from trimming and slicing to Slow Motion and Time effects. OpenShot is an excellent software for training and learning new video editing tricks, but it is best avoided if you are working on a large project. The software’s basic video editing features make it an excellent choice for users who only want to perform simple edits without having to waste too much time.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> OpenShot lets you add unlimited video and audio tracks to your projects, but its file management capabilities are far from impressive. The software allows you to trim or arrange the video files in any way you want, and it also provides a lot of different Transitions that can be used to make the videos look smoother. The collection of video and audio effects allows users to try out different solutions for the scenes in their video clips. OpenShot features a Vector Title Editor that can assist you in creating perfect opening titles or end credits.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The interface of this open-source video editing software is designed to assist its users through every step of the video editing process.

<p>There are very few video editing suites that can offer as much to its users as Adobe Premiere Pro can. It is probably one of the best video editors ever created, as it has been setting the industry standards for a long time. High-end professionals frequently use Adobe Premiere Pro on their projects, while aspiring filmmakers strive to learn every option this unique video editor has to offer. The much-famed software isn’t the best choice for video editors who are just learning the basics of the trade, although it supplies a staggering amount of tutorials and learning materials.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> With each new version of Adobe Premiere Pro the list of the software’s features becomes longer. Its timeline is famous for its ease of use because it enables you to add as much new audio or video tracks as your project requires. This is arguably one of the best color correction software packages on the market, while its color grading features are no less impressive. Adobe Premiere Pro provides support for a wide range of video file formats including 4K, HDR, and 360 VR videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Perfect for collaborative projects that involve large teams of experienced professionals. The software is at its best when used with other Adobe’s products that enable you to develop projects beyond the boundaries set by the Adobe Premiere Pro’s limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> You cannot purchase the lifetime license to use this video editing software, and paying monthly subscriptions may be hard on the budget of some of its potential users.</p>

<p>Successful independent artists, film producers, and all other film and video enthusiasts can only benefit from purchasing this video editing suite.

                ></p>
<p>Although it is often regarded as a simplified version of Premiere Pro, this video editing suite offers enough video editing tools to edit videos at the semi-professional level.

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Adobe Premiere Elements recognizes all popular video file formats, and it offers support for 4K content. In addition to its remarkable file format compatibility, the video editor also features 3D editing and face detection options that can be very useful when working on more complex video projects. The haze-removal effect is extremely efficient at reducing the fog or cigarette smoke in a shot, while the motion titles let you create visually impressive opening titles or end credits.

                ></p>
<p>This is probably one of the best and most popular video editing software packages aimed at amateur and semi-professional users. There are several versions of the software available, and each of them contains a different amount of options and video editing tools. Even with somewhat reduced capability, the least expensive version of the editor supports 360-degree as well as VR options for posting on social media such as Vimeo, Facebook or YouTube. CyberLink PowerDirector isn’t a professional video editing software, but it still offers a lot of extraordinary options that can take you a step closer to producing a professional video.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The 360-degree video editing options are probably the first thing that catches the eye when you look at the list of features the software provides, but its true power lies in its color tools. LUTs, HDR effects or Split Toning options are just the tip of the iceberg since PowerDirector offers countless tools for fine-tuning of the colors in your videos. Animated PIP effects and video collages make this video editing software a perfect choice for the production of tutorials and all other types of online videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The audio editing options provided by CyberLink PowerDirector are nothing short of amazing since they enable the software’s users to manipulate the audio files in any way they see fit.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Motion tracking and color lookup features are not always reliable. The software is a bit overpriced when compared with similar video editing suits.</p>

<p>Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades. Its software products may not enjoy the fame of Adobe’s video editing software packages, but this doesn’t mean that a video editor such as Magix Video Pro cannot be used for the production of professional-looking videos. Besides offering basic video editing tools this video editor also features advanced video editing options such as Stop Motion animation or 360-degree video editing. Magix Video Pro is often labeled as ‘one of the best video editing programs out there’.</p>

The video editing tools supplied by the Magix Video Pro are as impressive as its audio editing options. Lens correction features, Split screen videos or 360-degree video editing options reveal only a fraction of the software’s capabilities. Magix Video Pro delivers professional video editing features to consumer-level users.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The software allows you to place any type of media file on its timeline and use it in your project.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The effects library installation process can be time-consuming, although it is well worth the wait.</p>

KineMaster provides a wide range of video exporting options and allows you to share videos on popular social media networks.</p>

<p>As the Apple’s version of the Windows Movie Maker, iMovie has a similar status of a classic video editor that is at its best when used for simple video editing tasks.

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Both free and paid versions of this video editing suite offer support for wide range of video file formats.

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Royalty-free media and a remarkable VFX panel make Lightworks a tempting option for professional and amateur video editors alike.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The export options on the free version of the software are extremely limited and the software doesn’t provide much support for inexperienced users.</p>

<p>This simple video editing software has all the tools you’ll ever need to quickly polish your videos. Its audio and video effects can be utilized to make your videos look and sound professionally, but Avidemux doesn’t offer much more than these basic video editing options.</p>
<p>The software provides support for most of popular video file formats, but its export options are far from perfect. Avidemux doesn’t feature visual effects or transitions, which significantly limits its video editing capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Newcomers to the video editing world will love the software’s interface, because of its simplicity. The Transform feature allows you to fade in and fade out shots, crop or rotate video clips and even add logos to your videos. Blur or Sharpen effects enable users to enhance their videos, while contrast, brightness, saturation or hue values can be adjusted to make the colors in the video look more vivid. Avidemux also features the Subtitle option, but the software can only add hardcoded subtitles to videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Solves all your basic video editing problems, and lets you have fun while editing videos. Avidemux also has solid encoding options and its interface is user-friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There are no video effects or transitions, which narrows down the software’s video editing options.</p>

                ></p>
<p>VideoPad is one of the best entry-level cross-platform software products you can use for easy video editing tasks. The free version of the software is available to both Mac and PC users, although the Windows version limits the video exporting options to just two file formats. The VideoPad’s interface doesn’t take much time to get used to, and it perfectly adjusted to the needs of inexperienced video editors. Paid versions of the software are available to advanced editors who want to use VideoPad for more than just basic video editing.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The list of video editing features VideoPad provides includes several pleasant surprises. The 4K video support, as well as 360-video editing features, are aimed at GoPro owners who want a quick and easy way to process their footage. The visual effects this free video editing software provides are impressive, while the Chroma Key option enables its users to create green screen videos. Even though VideoPad allows its users to edit audio files, its audio editing features are fairly modest.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Learning how to use VideoPad is simplified by its intuitively designed interface.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There are no advanced video editing options like multi-cam editing and motion tracking and certain features become unavailable when using the free version of the software over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>This award-winning open-source video editor offers a wide range of video editing tools that span from trimming and slicing to Slow Motion and Time effects. OpenShot is an excellent software for training and learning new video editing tricks, but it is best avoided if you are working on a large project. The software’s basic video editing features make it an excellent choice for users who only want to perform simple edits without having to waste too much time.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> OpenShot lets you add unlimited video and audio tracks to your projects, but its file management capabilities are far from impressive. The software allows you to trim or arrange the video files in any way you want, and it also provides a lot of different Transitions that can be used to make the videos look smoother. The collection of video and audio effects allows users to try out different solutions for the scenes in their video clips. OpenShot features a Vector Title Editor that can assist you in creating perfect opening titles or end credits.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The interface of this open-source video editing software is designed to assist its users through every step of the video editing process. OpenShot is a great choice for all video editors who want to save money and use a powerful video editing software at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> More complex video editing options such as Rotoscoping, are not available. You may have to install add-ons if the OS you are using doesn’t meet the software’s system requirements.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Almost two decades ago, this open-source project was started by Jason Wood in order to develop a video editing software for Linux OS. Over the years, a small team of developers has created Windows and MacOS versions of the editor that now have a loyal fan base. Even though the software’s features make it a reliable choice for more complex projects, Kdnelive can also be used to perform simple edits. This video editing software combines the simplicity of entry-level video editors with advanced video editing tools frequently used by experienced professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The functionality of this video editor will surprise even the greatest of skeptics. The software’s timeline lets you to add as many videos and audio files to your project as you want, making it a perfect tool for large-scale projects. The visual effects and transitions enable users to manipulate the footage in any way they see fit, while the extremely powerful analysis tools such as histograms, waveforms or vectorscopes enable them to monitor all the adjustments they make on their footage.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Kdnlive provides support for nearly all input file formats that can be added easily to the software’s multitrack timeline. The free open-source add-ons can extend the video editor’s capability and thus enable you to perform a wider range of video editing actions.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Even though the software provides the screencast recording option, it doesn’t feature the PIP effect. Multi frame-rate editing isn’t possible and software’s updates can last for hours.</p>

                ></p>
<p>There are very few video editing suites that can offer as much to its users as Adobe Premiere Pro can. It is probably one of the best video editors ever created, as it has been setting the industry standards for a long time. High-end professionals frequently use Adobe Premiere Pro on their projects, while aspiring filmmakers strive to learn every option this unique video editor has to offer. The much-famed software isn’t the best choice for video editors who are just learning the basics of the trade, although it supplies a staggering amount of tutorials and learning materials.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> With each new version of Adobe Premiere Pro the list of the software’s features becomes longer. Its timeline is famous for its ease of use because it enables you to add as much new audio or video tracks as your project requires. This is arguably one of the best color correction software packages on the market, while its color grading features are no less impressive. Adobe Premiere Pro provides support for a wide range of video file formats including 4K, HDR, and 360 VR videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Perfect for collaborative projects that involve large teams of experienced professionals. The software is at its best when used with other Adobe’s products that enable you to develop projects beyond the boundaries set by the Adobe Premiere Pro’s limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> You cannot purchase the lifetime license to use this video editing software, and paying monthly subscriptions may be hard on the budget of some of its potential users.</p>

<p>Successful independent artists, film producers, and all other film and video enthusiasts can only benefit from purchasing this video editing suite. The software belonged to Sony Creative Software for much of its history, but on May 20. 2016 the company sold it to Magix. Previously known as Vegas Pro or just Vegas, this video editing software is widely accepted as one of the best professional video editing tools ever created. There is virtually no video editing task that cannot be completed in Magix Vegas Pro video editing software.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> This video editor is designed to provide support to its users from the beginning until the very end of the video editing process. Magix Vegas Pro recognizes almost all video file formats, even those captured with professional RED or ARRI Alexa cameras. You can use this software to edit 3D or 4K videos, while the Multicamera-Editing feature lets you switch between any number of video sources with a single mouse click. Effects such as Automatic Crossfades allow you to create transitions between shots effortlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The seemingly unlimited amount of learning resources makes editing with Magix Vegas Pro a lot easier and it enables less experienced video editors to learn new tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There aren’t as many visual effects as you would hope for and the software’s interface isn’t aesthetically pleasing, but it is very functional.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Although it is often regarded as a simplified version of Premiere Pro, this video editing suite offers enough video editing tools to edit videos at the semi-professional level. Adobe Premiere Elements contains automated versions of Premiere Pro’s features and in this manner it enables its users to utilize professional video editing tools on their prosumer level projects. Even though this Adobe’s software product lacks the power of professional video editing software packages, it still offers enough video editing tools for the production of nicely polished and well-rounded videos.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Adobe Premiere Elements recognizes all popular video file formats, and it offers support for 4K content. In addition to its remarkable file format compatibility, the video editor also features 3D editing and face detection options that can be very useful when working on more complex video projects. The haze-removal effect is extremely efficient at reducing the fog or cigarette smoke in a shot, while the motion titles let you create visually impressive opening titles or end credits. The Adobe Premiere Elements has performed exceptionally well when rendering large video files.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The software’s Guided mode provides support to its users and helps them learn how to perform all video editing actions. The asset management tool offers assistance with the organization of large amounts of video and audio files.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> When compared to other video editors in this guide Adobe Premiere Elements’ device and social media optimization features seem to be in short supply.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is probably one of the best and most popular video editing software packages aimed at amateur and semi-professional users. There are several versions of the software available, and each of them contains a different amount of options and video editing tools. Even with somewhat reduced capability, the least expensive version of the editor supports 360-degree as well as VR options for posting on social media such as Vimeo, Facebook or YouTube. CyberLink PowerDirector isn’t a professional video editing software, but it still offers a lot of extraordinary options that can take you a step closer to producing a professional video.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The 360-degree video editing options are probably the first thing that catches the eye when you look at the list of features the software provides, but its true power lies in its color tools. LUTs, HDR effects or Split Toning options are just the tip of the iceberg since PowerDirector offers countless tools for fine-tuning of the colors in your videos. Animated PIP effects and video collages make this video editing software a perfect choice for the production of tutorials and all other types of online videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The audio editing options provided by CyberLink PowerDirector are nothing short of amazing since they enable the software’s users to manipulate the audio files in any way they see fit.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Motion tracking and color lookup features are not always reliable. The software is a bit overpriced when compared with similar video editing suits.</p>

<p>Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades. Its software products may not enjoy the fame of Adobe’s video editing software packages, but this doesn’t mean that a video editor such as Magix Video Pro cannot be used for the production of professional-looking videos. Besides offering basic video editing tools this video editor also features advanced video editing options such as Stop Motion animation or 360-degree video editing. Magix Video Pro is often labeled as ‘one of the best video editing programs out there’.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Audio editing features that come with this video editor include an audio mixer that enables you to reduce noise levels, control the low, mid and high sounds or simply equalize the sound volume across the entire project. The video editing tools supplied by the Magix Video Pro are as impressive as its audio editing options. Lens correction features, Split screen videos or 360-degree video editing options reveal only a fraction of the software’s capabilities. Magix Video Pro delivers professional video editing features to consumer-level users.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The software allows you to place any type of media file on its timeline and use it in your project.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The effects library installation process can be time-consuming, although it is well worth the wait.</p>

<p>The world’s largest video sharing platform also offers basic video editing services.

Brightness, contrast or saturation levels can be altered if you want to enhance the colors in your videos.

However, some of the most important video editing features like adding the text or creating titles are not available.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Allows you to polish your videos before posting them on YouTube for free.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the oldest if not the oldest video editing software for PCs. Microsoft has announced that Windows Movie Maker will no longer be available for download. This software can still be found online, although not on Microsoft’s website, and currently, there are two different versions of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Windows Movie Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> available. Even the least experienced video editors can master each of the Movie Maker versions easily.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The classic video editing software is equipped with all the tools you’ll need for basic editing tasks like trimming, changing the video playback speed or rotating videos. It even features a Video Stabilization option that can be useful if you’d like to stabilize a video and remove the distracting camera shakes. Windows Movie Maker lets you add text effects to your video, insert Transitions between two takes, perform basic audio editing or record a screen.</p>

<p>As the Apple’s version of the Windows Movie Maker, iMovie has a similar status of a classic video editor that is at its best when used for simple video editing tasks. The video editor can also be used on an iPhone or an iPad if you want to edit your videos on the go. Learning your way around iMovie won’t take much of your time since all of its features are easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Editing 4K videos or making credits or titles are just a few among many options provided by iMovie. Adding transitions, applying split-screen effects or creating PIP videos doesn’t require you to be a skilled video editor, because all of these options are easily accessible and they can be used in any project you are working on.</p>
<p>The iMovie’s audio editing options are equally impressive since the software enables you to add music, use built-in sound effects and record voiceovers. The video editor supports most of the popular file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>Free, and comes bundled with your Mac</p>
<p>Intuitive interface</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro is probably one of the highest praised video editing software ever created. It has been used to edit cinematic masterpieces such as ‘What happened Miss Simone’ or ‘The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo’, which speaks volumes about the software’s capability. Final Cut Pro’s Magnetic Timeline 2 is one of the kind, and it makes organizing large amounts of video and audio files look easy. Although the software’s price may seem discouraging, those who invested in it never had to use another video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> A brief look at the list of Final Cut Pro’s video editing tools will leave you wondering if there is anything this software can’t do. Besides basic video editing features, the video editor is also equipped with 360 degrees VR video editing option, Multicam editing, and advanced color grading tools. Final Cut Pro allows its users to add as many audio tracks to the timeline as they want, thus enabling them to create impeccable soundtracks for their videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Working with large numbers of video files is simplified by the software’s timeline, while options such as 3D titles or VR contribute to the strong impression this editor leaves on all of its users.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Final Cut Pro has some lingering glitches that still haven’t been fixed, and its audio editing tool set lacks some important pieces.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Lightworks is one of the best video editing software on this list with a long history in the movie-making business. The free version of the software is available, but it has limited export options. A $25 monthly subscription is required in order to gain access to all of the software’s features. Although it may be a somewhat pricey option, purchasing Lightworks is a profitable investment that may help you improve the quality of your videos.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Both free and paid versions of this video editing suite offer support for wide range of video file formats. This can be very useful for video editors who often work on projects shot on different cameras. Multi-cam editing feature enables the software’s users to work with footage shot from separate angles, using more than just one camera. The videos edited with the free version of the software can only be exported to an MPEG4 file format with the maximum size of 1280X 790 pixels, and they must be uploaded to YouTube directly from the editor.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Royalty-free media and a remarkable VFX panel make Lightworks a tempting option for professional and amateur video editors alike.</p>

<p>Blender started out as an open-source project and over the years animators, scientists, VFX artists and numerous other people have participated in developing this 3D creation suite. The software can be used for modeling, animation, video editing or compositing, to mention only a few of its many purposes. Editing video footage isn’t Blender’s strong suit, but its video editing features are powerful enough to enable you to perform basic editing tasks. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t use this software to create videos that grab the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Cutting or trimming videos, adjusting the video’s playback speed or adding keyframes to a video clip is an easy process in Blender. The software’s true strength lies in its animation, 3D modeling or motion tracking features. The latest version of Blender is equipped with a motion tracking option that allows you to import the footage into the software directly from a camera. You can utilize this feature to mask areas of the shot and see the movement on camera in a 3D environment.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Blender’s price and its powerful features make it an interesting choice as your primary video editing software.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> You must have in-depth knowledge of animation, compositing, and 3D techniques in order to be able to use Blender.</p>

<p>This simple video editing software has all the tools you’ll ever need to quickly polish your videos. Its audio and video effects can be utilized to make your videos look and sound professionally, but Avidemux doesn’t offer much more than these basic video editing options.</p>
<p>The software provides support for most of popular video file formats, but its export options are far from perfect. Avidemux doesn’t feature visual effects or transitions, which significantly limits its video editing capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Newcomers to the video editing world will love the software’s interface, because of its simplicity. The Transform feature allows you to fade in and fade out shots, crop or rotate video clips and even add logos to your videos.

<p>VideoPad is one of the best entry-level cross-platform software products you can use for easy video editing tasks. The free version of the software is available to both Mac and PC users, although the Windows version limits the video exporting options to just two file formats. The VideoPad’s interface doesn’t take much time to get used to, and it perfectly adjusted to the needs of inexperienced video editors. Paid versions of the software are available to advanced editors who want to use VideoPad for more than just basic video editing.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The list of video editing features VideoPad provides includes several pleasant surprises. The 4K video support, as well as 360-video editing features, are aimed at GoPro owners who want a quick and easy way to process their footage. The visual effects this free video editing software provides are impressive, while the Chroma Key option enables its users to create green screen videos. Even though VideoPad allows its users to edit audio files, its audio editing features are fairly modest.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Learning how to use VideoPad is simplified by its intuitively designed interface.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There are no advanced video editing options like multi-cam editing and motion tracking and certain features become unavailable when using the free version of the software over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>This award-winning open-source video editor offers a wide range of video editing tools that span from trimming and slicing to Slow Motion and Time effects. OpenShot is an excellent software for training and learning new video editing tricks, but it is best avoided if you are working on a large project. The software’s basic video editing features make it an excellent choice for users who only want to perform simple edits without having to waste too much time.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> OpenShot lets you add unlimited video and audio tracks to your projects, but its file management capabilities are far from impressive. The software allows you to trim or arrange the video files in any way you want, and it also provides a lot of different Transitions that can be used to make the videos look smoother. The collection of video and audio effects allows users to try out different solutions for the scenes in their video clips. OpenShot features a Vector Title Editor that can assist you in creating perfect opening titles or end credits.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The interface of this open-source video editing software is designed to assist its users through every step of the video editing process.

                ></p>
<p>Almost two decades ago, this open-source project was started by Jason Wood in order to develop a video editing software for Linux OS. Over the years, a small team of developers has created Windows and MacOS versions of the editor that now have a loyal fan base. Even though the software’s features make it a reliable choice for more complex projects, Kdnelive can also be used to perform simple edits. This video editing software combines the simplicity of entry-level video editors with advanced video editing tools frequently used by experienced professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The functionality of this video editor will surprise even the greatest of skeptics.

<p>There are very few video editing suites that can offer as much to its users as Adobe Premiere Pro can. It is probably one of the best video editors ever created, as it has been setting the industry standards for a long time. High-end professionals frequently use Adobe Premiere Pro on their projects, while aspiring filmmakers strive to learn every option this unique video editor has to offer. The much-famed software isn’t the best choice for video editors who are just learning the basics of the trade, although it supplies a staggering amount of tutorials and learning materials.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> With each new version of Adobe Premiere Pro the list of the software’s features becomes longer. Its timeline is famous for its ease of use because it enables you to add as much new audio or video tracks as your project requires. This is arguably one of the best color correction software packages on the market, while its color grading features are no less impressive. Adobe Premiere Pro provides support for a wide range of video file formats including 4K, HDR, and 360 VR videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Perfect for collaborative projects that involve large teams of experienced professionals. The software is at its best when used with other Adobe’s products that enable you to develop projects beyond the boundaries set by the Adobe Premiere Pro’s limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> You cannot purchase the lifetime license to use this video editing software, and paying monthly subscriptions may be hard on the budget of some of its potential users.</p>

<p>Successful independent artists, film producers, and all other film and video enthusiasts can only benefit from purchasing this video editing suite. The software belonged to Sony Creative Software for much of its history, but on May 20. 2016 the company sold it to Magix. Previously known as Vegas Pro or just Vegas, this video editing software is widely accepted as one of the best professional video editing tools ever created. There is virtually no video editing task that cannot be completed in Magix Vegas Pro video editing software.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> This video editor is designed to provide support to its users from the beginning until the very end of the video editing process. Magix Vegas Pro recognizes almost all video file formats, even those captured with professional RED or ARRI Alexa cameras. You can use this software to edit 3D or 4K videos, while the Multicamera-Editing feature lets you switch between any number of video sources with a single mouse click. Effects such as Automatic Crossfades allow you to create transitions between shots effortlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The seemingly unlimited amount of learning resources makes editing with Magix Vegas Pro a lot easier and it enables less experienced video editors to learn new tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There aren’t as many visual effects as you would hope for and the software’s interface isn’t aesthetically pleasing, but it is very functional.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Although it is often regarded as a simplified version of Premiere Pro, this video editing suite offers enough video editing tools to edit videos at the semi-professional level. Adobe Premiere Elements contains automated versions of Premiere Pro’s features and in this manner it enables its users to utilize professional video editing tools on their prosumer level projects. Even though this Adobe’s software product lacks the power of professional video editing software packages, it still offers enough video editing tools for the production of nicely polished and well-rounded videos.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Adobe Premiere Elements recognizes all popular video file formats, and it offers support for 4K content. In addition to its remarkable file format compatibility, the video editor also features 3D editing and face detection options that can be very useful when working on more complex video projects. The haze-removal effect is extremely efficient at reducing the fog or cigarette smoke in a shot, while the motion titles let you create visually impressive opening titles or end credits. The Adobe Premiere Elements has performed exceptionally well when rendering large video files.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The software’s Guided mode provides support to its users and helps them learn how to perform all video editing actions. The asset management tool offers assistance with the organization of large amounts of video and audio files.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the best and most popular video editing software packages aimed at amateur and semi-professional users. There are several versions of the software available, and each of them contains a different amount of options and video editing tools. Even with somewhat reduced capability, the least expensive version of the editor supports 360-degree as well as VR options for posting on social media such as Vimeo, Facebook or YouTube. CyberLink PowerDirector isn’t a professional video editing software, but it still offers a lot of extraordinary options that can take you a step closer to producing a professional video.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The 360-degree video editing options are probably the first thing that catches the eye when you look at the list of features the software provides, but its true power lies in its color tools. LUTs, HDR effects or Split Toning options are just the tip of the iceberg since PowerDirector offers countless tools for fine-tuning of the colors in your videos. Animated PIP effects and video collages make this video editing software a perfect choice for the production of tutorials and all other types of online videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The audio editing options provided by CyberLink PowerDirector are nothing short of amazing since they enable the software’s users to manipulate the audio files in any way they see fit.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Motion tracking and color lookup features are not always reliable. The software is a bit overpriced when compared with similar video editing suits.</p>

<p>Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades. Its software products may not enjoy the fame of Adobe’s video editing software packages, but this doesn’t mean that a video editor such as Magix Video Pro cannot be used for the production of professional-looking videos. Besides offering basic video editing tools this video editor also features advanced video editing options such as Stop Motion animation or 360-degree video editing. Magix Video Pro is often labeled as ‘one of the best video editing programs out there’.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Audio editing features that come with this video editor include an audio mixer that enables you to reduce noise levels, control the low, mid and high sounds or simply equalize the sound volume across the entire project. The video editing tools supplied by the Magix Video Pro are as impressive as its audio editing options. Lens correction features, Split screen videos or 360-degree video editing options reveal only a fraction of the software’s capabilities. Magix Video Pro delivers professional video editing features to consumer-level users.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The software allows you to place any type of media file on its timeline and use it in your project.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The effects library installation process can be time-consuming, although it is well worth the wait.</p>

<p>Unlike the Adobe’s app for mobile video editing, PowerDirector lives up to all expectations. This user-friendly app lets you create reverse, 4K, or green screen videos. To make things even better, you can easily apply visual and audio effects or add voiceovers to your projects. In addition to the video editor, the PowerDirector app is also equipped with a powerful photo editor that lets you manipulate images in a professional manner. You can use almost any type of video or audio file in this app because it provides support for all commonly used file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> PowerDirector is designed to help its users polish their video quickly and effortlessly.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Videos in 1080p and 4K resolutions can only be exported after you’ve made an in-app purchase.</p>
<p>Ooops…It looks like there isn’t any tool that matches your demand. Please give it another try.</p>

<p>As the Apple’s version of the Windows Movie Maker, iMovie has a similar status of a classic video editor that is at its best when used for simple video editing tasks. The video editor can also be used on an iPhone or an iPad if you want to edit your videos on the go. Learning your way around iMovie won’t take much of your time since all of its features are easy to use.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Editing 4K videos or making credits or titles are just a few among many options provided by iMovie. Adding transitions, applying split-screen effects or creating PIP videos doesn’t require you to be a skilled video editor, because all of these options are easily accessible and they can be used in any project you are working on.</p>
<p>The iMovie’s audio editing options are equally impressive since the software enables you to add music, use built-in sound effects and record voiceovers. The video editor supports most of the popular file formats.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong></p>
<p>Free, and comes bundled with your Mac</p>
<p>Intuitive interface</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong></p>
<p>This classic video editor for Apple’s devices doesn’t offer advanced video editing options such as motion tracking or keyframe marking.</p>

<p>Final Cut Pro is probably one of the highest praised video editing software ever created. It has been used to edit cinematic masterpieces such as ‘What happened Miss Simone’ or ‘The Girl With a Dragon Tattoo’, which speaks volumes about the software’s capability. Final Cut Pro’s Magnetic Timeline 2 is one of the kind, and it makes organizing large amounts of video and audio files look easy. Although the software’s price may seem discouraging, those who invested in it never had to use another video editor.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> A brief look at the list of Final Cut Pro’s video editing tools will leave you wondering if there is anything this software can’t do. Besides basic video editing features, the video editor is also equipped with 360 degrees VR video editing option, Multicam editing, and advanced color grading tools. Final Cut Pro allows its users to add as many audio tracks to the timeline as they want, thus enabling them to create impeccable soundtracks for their videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Working with large numbers of video files is simplified by the software’s timeline, while options such as 3D titles or VR contribute to the strong impression this editor leaves on all of its users.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Final Cut Pro has some lingering glitches that still haven’t been fixed, and its audio editing tool set lacks some important pieces.</p>

<p><strong>Features:</strong> Both free and paid versions of this video editing suite offer support for wide range of video file formats. This can be very useful for video editors who often work on projects shot on different cameras.

<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The export options on the free version of the software are extremely limited and the software doesn’t provide much support for inexperienced users.</p>

<p>Blender started out as an open-source project and over the years animators, scientists, VFX artists and numerous other people have participated in developing this 3D creation suite. The software can be used for modeling, animation, video editing or compositing, to mention only a few of its many purposes. Editing video footage isn’t Blender’s strong suit, but its video editing features are powerful enough to enable you to perform basic editing tasks. However, this doesn’t mean you can’t use this software to create videos that grab the viewer’s attention.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Cutting or trimming videos, adjusting the video’s playback speed or adding keyframes to a video clip is an easy process in Blender. The software’s true strength lies in its animation, 3D modeling or motion tracking features. The latest version of Blender is equipped with a motion tracking option that allows you to import the footage into the software directly from a camera. You can utilize this feature to mask areas of the shot and see the movement on camera in a 3D environment.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Blender’s price and its powerful features make it an interesting choice as your primary video editing software.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> You must have in-depth knowledge of animation, compositing, and 3D techniques in order to be able to use Blender.</p>

<p>This simple video editing software has all the tools you’ll ever need to quickly polish your videos. Its audio and video effects can be utilized to make your videos look and sound professionally, but Avidemux doesn’t offer much more than these basic video editing options.</p>
<p>The software provides support for most of popular video file formats, but its export options are far from perfect. Avidemux doesn’t feature visual effects or transitions, which significantly limits its video editing capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Newcomers to the video editing world will love the software’s interface, because of its simplicity. The Transform feature allows you to fade in and fade out shots, crop or rotate video clips and even add logos to your videos.

<p>VideoPad is one of the best entry-level cross-platform software products you can use for easy video editing tasks. The free version of the software is available to both Mac and PC users, although the Windows version limits the video exporting options to just two file formats. The VideoPad’s interface doesn’t take much time to get used to, and it perfectly adjusted to the needs of inexperienced video editors. Paid versions of the software are available to advanced editors who want to use VideoPad for more than just basic video editing.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The list of video editing features VideoPad provides includes several pleasant surprises. The 4K video support, as well as 360-video editing features, are aimed at GoPro owners who want a quick and easy way to process their footage. The visual effects this free video editing software provides are impressive, while the Chroma Key option enables its users to create green screen videos. Even though VideoPad allows its users to edit audio files, its audio editing features are fairly modest.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Learning how to use VideoPad is simplified by its intuitively designed interface.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There are no advanced video editing options like multi-cam editing and motion tracking and certain features become unavailable when using the free version of the software over a longer period of time.</p>

<p>This award-winning open-source video editor offers a wide range of video editing tools that span from trimming and slicing to Slow Motion and Time effects. OpenShot is an excellent software for training and learning new video editing tricks, but it is best avoided if you are working on a large project. The software’s basic video editing features make it an excellent choice for users who only want to perform simple edits without having to waste too much time.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> OpenShot lets you add unlimited video and audio tracks to your projects, but its file management capabilities are far from impressive. The software allows you to trim or arrange the video files in any way you want, and it also provides a lot of different Transitions that can be used to make the videos look smoother. The collection of video and audio effects allows users to try out different solutions for the scenes in their video clips. OpenShot features a Vector Title Editor that can assist you in creating perfect opening titles or end credits.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The interface of this open-source video editing software is designed to assist its users through every step of the video editing process.

<p>Almost two decades ago, this open-source project was started by Jason Wood in order to develop a video editing software for Linux OS. Over the years, a small team of developers has created Windows and MacOS versions of the editor that now have a loyal fan base. Even though the software’s features make it a reliable choice for more complex projects, Kdnelive can also be used to perform simple edits. This video editing software combines the simplicity of entry-level video editors with advanced video editing tools frequently used by experienced professionals.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The functionality of this video editor will surprise even the greatest of skeptics. The software’s timeline lets you to add as many videos and audio files to your project as you want, making it a perfect tool for large-scale projects.

<p>There are very few video editing suites that can offer as much to its users as Adobe Premiere Pro can. It is probably one of the best video editors ever created, as it has been setting the industry standards for a long time. High-end professionals frequently use Adobe Premiere Pro on their projects, while aspiring filmmakers strive to learn every option this unique video editor has to offer. The much-famed software isn’t the best choice for video editors who are just learning the basics of the trade, although it supplies a staggering amount of tutorials and learning materials.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> With each new version of Adobe Premiere Pro the list of the software’s features becomes longer. Its timeline is famous for its ease of use because it enables you to add as much new audio or video tracks as your project requires. This is arguably one of the best color correction software packages on the market, while its color grading features are no less impressive. Adobe Premiere Pro provides support for a wide range of video file formats including 4K, HDR, and 360 VR videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> Perfect for collaborative projects that involve large teams of experienced professionals. The software is at its best when used with other Adobe’s products that enable you to develop projects beyond the boundaries set by the Adobe Premiere Pro’s limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> You cannot purchase the lifetime license to use this video editing software, and paying monthly subscriptions may be hard on the budget of some of its potential users.</p>

There is virtually no video editing task that cannot be completed in Magix Vegas Pro video editing software.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> This video editor is designed to provide support to its users from the beginning until the very end of the video editing process. Magix Vegas Pro recognizes almost all video file formats, even those captured with professional RED or ARRI Alexa cameras.

<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The seemingly unlimited amount of learning resources makes editing with Magix Vegas Pro a lot easier and it enables less experienced video editors to learn new tricks.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> There aren’t as many visual effects as you would hope for and the software’s interface isn’t aesthetically pleasing, but it is very functional.</p>

<p>Although it is often regarded as a simplified version of Premiere Pro, this video editing suite offers enough video editing tools to edit videos at the semi-professional level. Adobe Premiere Elements contains automated versions of Premiere Pro’s features and in this manner it enables its users to utilize professional video editing tools on their prosumer level projects. Even though this Adobe’s software product lacks the power of professional video editing software packages, it still offers enough video editing tools for the production of nicely polished and well-rounded videos.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Adobe Premiere Elements recognizes all popular video file formats, and it offers support for 4K content. In addition to its remarkable file format compatibility, the video editor also features 3D editing and face detection options that can be very useful when working on more complex video projects. The haze-removal effect is extremely efficient at reducing the fog or cigarette smoke in a shot, while the motion titles let you create visually impressive opening titles or end credits. The Adobe Premiere Elements has performed exceptionally well when rendering large video files.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The software’s Guided mode provides support to its users and helps them learn how to perform all video editing actions. The asset management tool offers assistance with the organization of large amounts of video and audio files.</p>

<p>This is probably one of the best and most popular video editing software packages aimed at amateur and semi-professional users. There are several versions of the software available, and each of them contains a different amount of options and video editing tools. Even with somewhat reduced capability, the least expensive version of the editor supports 360-degree as well as VR options for posting on social media such as Vimeo, Facebook or YouTube. CyberLink PowerDirector isn’t a professional video editing software, but it still offers a lot of extraordinary options that can take you a step closer to producing a professional video.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> The 360-degree video editing options are probably the first thing that catches the eye when you look at the list of features the software provides, but its true power lies in its color tools. LUTs, HDR effects or Split Toning options are just the tip of the iceberg since PowerDirector offers countless tools for fine-tuning of the colors in your videos. Animated PIP effects and video collages make this video editing software a perfect choice for the production of tutorials and all other types of online videos.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The audio editing options provided by CyberLink PowerDirector are nothing short of amazing since they enable the software’s users to manipulate the audio files in any way they see fit.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Motion tracking and color lookup features are not always reliable. The software is a bit overpriced when compared with similar video editing suits.</p>

<p>Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades. Its software products may not enjoy the fame of Adobe’s video editing software packages, but this doesn’t mean that a video editor such as Magix Video Pro cannot be used for the production of professional-looking videos. Besides offering basic video editing tools this video editor also features advanced video editing options such as Stop Motion animation or 360-degree video editing. Magix Video Pro is often labeled as ‘one of the best video editing programs out there’.</p>
<p><strong>Features:</strong> Audio editing features that come with this video editor include an audio mixer that enables you to reduce noise levels, control the low, mid and high sounds or simply equalize the sound volume across the entire project. The video editing tools supplied by the Magix Video Pro are as impressive as its audio editing options. Lens correction features, Split screen videos or 360-degree video editing options reveal only a fraction of the software’s capabilities. Magix Video Pro delivers professional video editing features to consumer-level users.</p>
<p><strong>Advantages:</strong> The software allows you to place any type of media file on its timeline and use it in your project.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> The effects library installation process can be time-consuming, although it is well worth the wait.</p>

<p>This cross-platform video editor is one of the premier options for mobile video editing on both iOS and Android devices. KineMaster is currently the only app that enables Android Smartphone owners to add as many layers of videos, photos, and text to their projects as they want. However, it only supports a limited number of video file formats, which means that the app shouldn’t be used to edit videos that weren’t recorded on an iPhone or Android phone. KineMaster provides a wide range of video exporting options and allows you to share videos on popular social media networks.</p>
<p><strong>Pros:</strong> Above average video and audio editing features.</p>
<p><strong>Limitations:</strong> Offers a lot of options mobile video editors seldom use.</p>

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024</h2><p>Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>
<h4 id="2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10"><a href="#2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10" class="headerlink" title="2.

The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>

Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>
<h4 id="4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020"><a href="#4-Avidemux-–Best-Free-Open-Source-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-in-2020" class="headerlink" title="4.

Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras.

<p>The popularity of video content on social media networks has been soaring in the last couple of years, and it is only reasonable to expect this trend to continue. Tutorials, promotional videos and various other types of videos for social media help companies run successful advertising campaigns and increase their profits. You don’t have to be a seasoned video editing professional in order to create videos for social networks, in fact, you can make viral videos even with entry-level video editing software, like iMovie or Avidemux. That’s the reason why in this article we are going to introduce you to 10+ best video editing apps you can use online, on Mac and PC computers or Smartphones.</p>
<h2 id="Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-1"><a href="#Best-Video-Editing-Software-for-Novice-Video-Content-Creators-in-2024-1" class="headerlink" title="Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024"></a>Best Video Editing Software for Novice Video Content Creators in 2024</h2><p>Anyone who has access to a computer that runs on a macOS or Windows OS can edit videos for free because both of these operating systems have built-in video editing software. Let’s take a look at the free video editing options Mac and PC users have at their disposal in 2024.</p>
<h4 id="1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-1"><a href="#1-iMovie-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-macOS-and-iOS-1" class="headerlink" title="1. iMovie –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS"></a>1. <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.apple.com/imovie/" >iMovie <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> –Best Free Video Editing Software for Beginners on macOS and iOS</h4><p>Learning how to use iMovie to create videos for social media won’t take too much of your time, as the app’s intuitive interface makes performing all basic video editing actions look easy. iMovie lets you edit footage recorded in resolutions up to 4K and it features 10 high fidelity filters that enhance the colors in your videos. The app also lets you create PIP and split screen videos, alter the playback speed of a video clip or create engaging opening titles or end credits. The royalty-free music, sound effects or the voiceover recording feature can all help you create a perfect soundtrack for each video you edit in iMovie.</p>
<h4 id="2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-1"><a href="#2-Photos-App-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-10-1" class="headerlink" title="2.

The app’s Edit&amp;Create menu offers Draw, Add slo-mo or Trim tools that allow you to draw over the source footage and remove unwanted pieces of video clips from the timeline. The Photos App is equipped with a number of 3D effects and a rich collection of filters that can assist you in creating a distinctive visual style for each new video you edit with it. However, the app’s exporting options are far from impressive, since you can’t export your projects to social media directly from the Photos App.</p>
<h4 id="3-Windows-Movie-Maker-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-8-7-1"><a href="#3-Windows-Movie-Maker-–Best-Free-Video-Editing-Software-for-Beginners-on-Windows-8-7-1" class="headerlink" title="3.

Windows Movie Maker grants you access to a huge collection of transitions and visual effects and it makes the process of creating titles effortless. Certain options like video stabilization are only available on the version of the video editing software that is compatible with Windows 8, and the exact list of the tools provided by Windows Movie Maker varies on different versions of the Windows OS.</p>

This open source video editor is compatible with Linux, macOS and Windows OS, which means that you can edit videos with it regardless of the computer you have. Avidemux supports nearly all video file formats, and it is a perfect choice for all video content creators who frequently shoot their videos on different cameras. Nonetheless, the number of video editing tools Avidemux offers is far from impressive which limits your options during the video editing process.</p>

Once you know what you want to accomplish you should <strong>acquire as much information as you possibly can about a video editing software</strong> in order to find out if the video editor you’re considering can help you accomplish your goal. The <strong>price</strong> is yet another factor you should consider since you don’t have to spend a lot of money on video editing software that takes years to master if you just want to create a promotional video for your company.</p>
<p>Besides the features, a video editing application offers, you should also <strong>try to find out how user-friendly its interface is</strong> and how <strong>comfortable or efficient</strong> you are while working on a project in a video editing software. <strong>Installing a trial version</strong> of a video editor might help you decide if that editor is the right choice for you. If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>

Once you know what you want to accomplish you should <strong>acquire as much information as you possibly can about a video editing software</strong> in order to find out if the video editor you’re considering can help you accomplish your goal. The <strong>price</strong> is yet another factor you should consider since you don’t have to spend a lot of money on video editing software that takes years to master if you just want to create a promotional video for your company.</p>
<p>Besides the features, a video editing application offers, you should also <strong>try to find out how user-friendly its interface is</strong> and how <strong>comfortable or efficient</strong> you are while working on a project in a video editing software. <strong>Installing a trial version</strong> of a video editor might help you decide if that editor is the right choice for you. If you have absolutely no previous video editing experience, then it is best to start with a simple video editing app like iMovie or the Photos App and then switch to a more advanced video editor once you develop your video editing skills.</p>
