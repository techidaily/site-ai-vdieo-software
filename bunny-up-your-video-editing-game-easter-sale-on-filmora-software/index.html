However, the size is not only meant by the dimensions. Resolution and aspect ratio are also equally important for having the perfect size of the video and images. When you talk about the videos, the best dimension and resolution is considered to be 1080 by 1920p. Similarly, the aspect ratio for these videos is 16:When you create short video on YouTube then this youtube <strong>shorts aspect ratio</strong> remains the same because videos in this resolution and aspect ratio perform the best as they are in full HD.</p>
<p>Talking about videos, YouTube images cannot be neglected. If you will not follow the recommended size of YouTube images then you may have to face issues in posting them. YouTube images are at best when they are posted in the perfect size. Banner images on YouTube must be posted in the size of 2560 by 1440 pixels. Size of images may also change depending on the device that you are using. This can be different on desktops and tablets accordingly. On desktops, the size is 2560 by 423 and on tablets, the size becomes 1855 by 423.</p>

This is so important because without frame rate your video will not get the desired quality. It is must to know thing that video which you are posting must be in the actual and same frame rate in which it has been recorded. The most common frame rates for YouTube videos are 24, 48, 30, 25 and 60. However you can post the videos in any other frame rate but these are recommended the most.</p>
<p>It is equally important to deinterlace the content before you are posting it. This means if your video has 1080i60p and you want to convert it into 1080i30p then you will need to change the frame rate first.</p>

YouTube allows all the video dimensions between these ranges. The most accurate YouTube dimension is 1920 by 1080 pixels. The guidelines that are followed on YouTube videos are pretty clear.

This may also boost the audience number on your videos. To change the video size of YouTube, you will just need to follow some simple steps that are mentioned here:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all, you will have to open the video whose size you want to change. After this you will have to open the setting option from the icons that are displayed below the video.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> After opening the settings icon, you will find the option of quality. Choose that option and there you will see a list of dimensions amongst which you have to choose the one in which you wish to put your video. For example it may be 720p or less and more.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> As soon you choose the dimension or resolution the next step you have to do is go for it and click on save option and your video size is changed.</p>

Keep in mind that you create the videos in horizontal mode. This will look professional as well as will boost your video quality too. Also it is worth considering that the video dimensions matter a lot when you are creating the videos. Do consider the device that you are using to create the video as many devices can create the videos in the highest resolution possible.</p>
<p> You must also know that videos with higher dimension and resolution need more space so before making the videos do have a check on your storage space too. It is also a good idea to maintain the balance between high quality videos and your storage space.</p>

This is only possible when you will have excellent and engaging thumbnails so that they get more clicks. Here are some ideas that you can opt for your video thumbnail in order to get it more audience and views:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Go for video still:</strong> It will be an interesting idea to add video still to your YouTube videos. By doing so you can give your audience an excitement about what they are going to experience. Video still can do the work of giving a glance to your audience and afterwards if they will see the similar things then they will be satisfied about what your deliver to them.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Boost curiosity:</strong> sparking curiosity in your audience is another way to get more clicks on your videos thumbnails. Being curious about a particular topic makes the viewer stay up to the end. Suppose that if you pass the same message that they can easily guess then they will lose interest in your video. Try to have some spark of curiosity in the videos which will make them more engaging.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Perk of using contrasting colors:</strong> As far YouTube videos are concerned using colors is neglected but it can be a perk to your videos and thumbnails. You can use colors to make your videos look notable and eye-catching and also suiting the YouTube platform. Colors are powerful to draw your audience’s attention but for making it hold you will have to add other elements also.</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> <strong>Using the correct tools:</strong> Without proper editing, video creation is of no use. You will need to edit your videos wisely and make sure to add sparking elements to them. You may get many tools like <strong>Filmora,</strong> which can do the desired work for you.

<p>Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don’t want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you’ll learn in this article.</p>

<ul>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don’t like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.</p>
<p>I’ll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called “trimming”) and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called “cropping”). You get to pick which one works the best for you.</p>
<h4 id="TRIMMING"><a href="#TRIMMING" class="headerlink" title="TRIMMING"></a>TRIMMING</h4><p>Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.</p>

<p>For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (&lt;<a href="http://www.pond5.com>">www.pond5.com&gt;</a>). Let’s say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.</p>

                ></p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose “Crop.”</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I’ll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.</p>
<p>NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the “Done” button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p>But, it actually isn’t black, it’s transparent. If you put another clip below it, you’ll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.</p>
<p>Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.</p>
<h4 id="CROPPING"><a href="#CROPPING" class="headerlink" title="CROPPING"></a>CROPPING</h4><p>Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.</p>

<p>Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.</p>

<p>Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don’t see it.</p>

<p>Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don’t want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you’ll learn in this article.</p>

<ul>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don’t like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.</p>
<p>I’ll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called “trimming”) and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called “cropping”). You get to pick which one works the best for you.</p>
<h4 id="TRIMMING-1"><a href="#TRIMMING-1" class="headerlink" title="TRIMMING"></a>TRIMMING</h4><p>Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop001.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>For instance, here an image - courtesy of Pond5 (&lt;<a href="http://www.pond5.com>">www.pond5.com&gt;</a>). Let’s say that we want to emphasize the barn and not the sky.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop002.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>The easiest way to do this is to click the icon in the lower left corner of the Viewer and choose “Crop.”</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop003.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>This displays the cropping tools in the Viewer.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop004.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Click the Trim button to turn on Trim mode. (This article discusses Trim and Crop. I’ll cover the Ken Burns effect in a future article.)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop005.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.</p>
<p>NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop006.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Drag other corners or edges to further trim the image.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop007.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>When you have trimmed the image the way you want, click the “Done” button in the top right corner to exit trimming mode.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop008.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>If no other clip is below the trimmed clip, the background will be black.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/crop009.jpg"
                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>But, it actually isn’t black, it’s transparent. If you put another clip below it, you’ll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.</p>
<p>Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.</p>
<h4 id="CROPPING-1"><a href="#CROPPING-1" class="headerlink" title="CROPPING"></a>CROPPING</h4><p>Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.</p>
<p>There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:</p>

<h4 id="TRIMMING-2"><a href="#TRIMMING-2" class="headerlink" title="TRIMMING"></a>TRIMMING</h4><p>Trimming is the process of removing portions of a video clip without changing the size of the clip. This retains the highest amount of image quality.</p>

<p>Grab one of the blue dots and drag to hide portions of the frame. I generally grab a corner, but any blue dot will do.</p>
<p>NOTE: Press and hold the Option key while dragging to drag opposite edges or corners. Press and hold the Shift key to constrain the trim to the same aspect ratio as the frame.</p>

<p>But, it actually isn’t black, it’s transparent. If you put another clip below it, you’ll see the lower clip underneath the trimmed image.</p>
<p>Trimming allows us to hide portions of a video clip, without changing the image quality of the clip that remains. However, trimming always creates transparent sections within an image.</p>
<h4 id="CROPPING-2"><a href="#CROPPING-2" class="headerlink" title="CROPPING"></a>CROPPING</h4><p>Cropping allows us to select just a portion of a video clip, without creating any transparent sections, BUT, it degrades image quality.</p>
<p>There are several ways we can choose to crop an image:</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<li>Right-mouse click (or Control-click) inside the Viewer and choose</li>
<li>Type Shift+C</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p>* In the Inspector &gt; Video tab &gt; Crop (this option provides the most precision, but is the least intuitive to use)</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

<p>If you selected any option except the Inspector, click the Crop button in the Viewer.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p>Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.</p>
<p>Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p>Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don’t see it.</p>
<p>And, if you look closely, you’ll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.</p>

                ></p>
<p>To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word “Crop.”</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-2"><a href="#SUMMARY-2" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.</p>
<p>Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don’t crop too much.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.</p>

<p>Cropping an image means to remove a portion of the image, either to hide something you don’t want the audience to see or emphasize different elements within the image. Just as Photoshop allows us to crop still images, Final Cut Pro X allows us to crop moving video clips, as you’ll learn in this article.</p>

<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
<li>1920 x 1080 pixels</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike still images which can be thousands of pixels on a side, video clips are locked into one of these two sizes. This means that if you crop a video clip, to remove something you don’t like, the remaining pixels are often enlarged to fill the frame. Crop too much and your video clip will look blurry, blocky, and edges will look stair-stepped.</p>
<p>I’ll show you two ways to crop a video clip in this article, one that maintains a high image quality but reduces the size of the frame (called “trimming”) and the other that fills the frame with the image but reduces image quality (called “cropping”).

                ></p>
<p>Now, drag a blue button in one of the corners. Because cropping, unlike trimming, fills the frame with the portion of the image we select, we can only move corners and the image is always sized to match the aspect ratio of our sequence.</p>
<p>Final Cut displays numbers at the top of the Viewer indicating how much the image has been cropped.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Reposition the frame by grabbing inside the rectangle and dragging.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>When you are happy with the results, click the Done button in the top right corner.</p>

                      alt="how to crop an image with final cut pro"
                ></p>
<p>Notice that the selected portion of the image now fills the frame. Even though there is a clip below our cropped clip, we don’t see it.</p>
<p>And, if you look closely, you’ll see that the cropped image is softer (blurrier) than the original and edges are more likely to be stair-stepped.</p>

                ></p>
<p>To reset a cropped image back to its default settings, open the Inspector and click the small curved arrow to the right of the word “Crop.”</p>
<h4 id="SUMMARY-3"><a href="#SUMMARY-3" class="headerlink" title="SUMMARY"></a>SUMMARY</h4><p>Trimming is used to hide portions of an image and superimpose it over another image.</p>
<p>Cropping is used to reframe an image, say from a medium shot to a close-up, but runs the risk of overly softening an image. The general rule is that cropping a little is OK, but don’t crop too much.</p>
<p>I use both these techniques frequently in my own editing.</p>
