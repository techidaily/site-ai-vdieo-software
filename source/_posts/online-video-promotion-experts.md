Furthermore, you can also choose if you want to use the platform’s music library or upload the audio file you intend to use as a soundtrack for the video trailer you are making.

The number of pictures you can include in a photo collage can vary from just **two to more than 75** and it depends on the template you choose. You can also automatically desaturate all the images in a photo collage by clicking on the **B&W/Color icon** or **change the background** with a single click. Photo Collage Maker doesn’t offer any border options, so you can’t really control the spacing between the images. Downloading a 1-megapixel file from this platform is going to cost you $5.56.
