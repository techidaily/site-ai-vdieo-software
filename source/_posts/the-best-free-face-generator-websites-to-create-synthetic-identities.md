### 4\. Massless

**Website:** [https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai](https://massless.io/tool/face-maker-ai/)

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing. However, because you can’t always be precise while sketching with the mouse, it would be good to have access to a digital drawing pad to create the faces with a pen. With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

* Open a web browser, and visit the URL given above. Click any icons from the toolbox at the top (E.g., **Nose**).
* Draw a shape on its corresponding face area on the left (E.g., **Nose**), and wait while the portal automatically updates the photo on the right.
* Repeat the process to sketch other parts of the face, and click the More icon (with three vertical dots) from the top-right corner.
* Click **Download images** from the page that opens next to download the photo to your PC and use it wherever needed.

### 5\. This Person Does Not Exist

**Website:** <https://thispersondoesnotexist.com/>

This free online virtual face generator is probably the easiest and quickest. As you go to the website, it displays a random realistic image of a person that may not exist. If you don’t like the idea, you can change it with merely a single mouse click. Because the portal doesn’t have any Download button at the time of this writing, you must rely on the web browser’s default downloading process to get the image to your PC.

You can follow the instructions that are given below to switch between the images and download the one you like:

* Use your preferred web browser (Google Chrome here) to visit the URL provided above, and then notice the random image that appears on the page;
* Click **Another** from the box that appears at the bottom-right corner to change the image, repeat this process until you find a good photo for your avatar, and then right-click anywhere on the image.
* Click **Save image** from the context menu to save the photo. And then go to the default download folder to access the downloaded image, and use the picture wherever needed.

**Note:** Different browsers may have this feature with other names

### 6\. BoredHumans

**Website**: <https://boredhumans.com/faces.php>

This web portal is identical to the previous one as it generates random virtual faces with merely one mouse click. Even this website doesn’t have any Download button to help you download the image. Therefore, you must use the browser’s built-in feature to obtain the photo you want to save to your PC.

You can learn how to use BoredHumans to generate virtual faces and download them to your computer by following the steps given below:

* Open a web browser (Google Chrome here) and visit the URL provided above, and then click **Generate Another Fake Human** if you don’t like the one that appears;
* Keep clicking the button until you find a face that can be used as your avatar. Alternatively, you can click the **Generate A Human** button to create a less realistic image of a random person.

![free online face generators boredhumans](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-boredhumans.jpg)

* Right-click the image and click **Save image** to download the photo to your PC; and then get to the default download location to access the photo and use it wherever needed.

### 7\. faceMaker

**Website**: <https://facemaker.uvrg.org/>

faceMaker allows you to generate virtual faces out of the fine details that you specify during the creation process. These details are adjusted using the sliders that affect the corresponding physical attributes of the avatars. For example, you can modify the lips, eye color, hair, face roundness, mouse depth, jaw shape, etc. using their respective sliders.

You can follow the steps that are given below to learn how to create a virtual face using faceMaker, and save it to your PC to use it as an avatar:

* Use your preferred web browser to visit the URL given above and click **Start** from the main page.
* Fill out the questionnaire by choosing your preferred options and agreeing to the term and conditions.
* Click **Start** and then click **Continue** on the next page. Use the sliders on the left and right panels to customize the face as needed, and once done, you can use any screen capturing tool to take a snapshot and remove the sliders by cropping the image, thus having only the virtual face.

![free online face generators facemaker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-online-face-generators-facemaker.jpg)
