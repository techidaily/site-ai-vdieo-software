## Part 1: How to convert 4k Videos to MP4 format or any formats

To convert the 4k video footage to mp4 formats or any other formats, such as AVI, MOV, 1080p/720p/480p MP4, and WMV, you should begin by downloading the [Wondershare Video UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

#### Step 1. Import files

You should import the video files which you wish to convert to the Converter tool. There you have an option of directly using drag and drop into the application or by going to the ‘File’ button in the menu bar and choosing ‘Load Media Files’.

#### Step 2. Setting the desired format

**Conversion of videos to the 4K MP4 format:**

By clicking on the ‘Format’ button which is found at the bottom of the panel, it will open the dialogue box of the format window. In the ‘format’ icon, you will find the ‘video’ option. There select the format of ‘4K Video MP4’.

**Conversion of 4K or Ultra HD videos into other audio and video formats.**

Start by clicking the ‘format’ button found below on the screen. In the ‘format’ option select ‘video’ or ‘audio’ categories, this is where you will find various audio and video formats. Select the one which you require.

For converting 4K or Ultra HD format video into MOV, WMV, HD MP4, MKV, WMV etc. in 720p or 108p, follow this method. Go to the ‘format’ icon and select the ‘HD’ option. Click on the ‘settings’ option on the bottom right side to open the settings popup, here you can select video resolutions from 1920\*1080 or 1280\*720.

#### Step 3. Conversion of videos

Click on to the ‘Convert’ icon to start the process of converting videos from 4K MP4 videos to other formats or vice versa.

## Part 2: How to Download 4K Videos to MP4

#### Step 1.Installing the 4K Video Downloader

The foremost step is downloading the software and getting it installed. After installation, launch this program and browse through it to get a hang of it. Its user-friendly interface will make your work a lot easier.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/get-started-4.jpg)

#### Step 2. Search for the 4K videos you wish to download

4K videos are supported in the browsers of Chrome, Firefox, and IE. In any of these browsers go to the media streaming websites. Search for the type of 4K videos you like. Select one and play that video.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/download-5.jpg)

#### Step 3. Download 4K videos

In the browser when your video is loading, you will find a floating Download button. It will emerge at the above right corner of the video frame. Now one can download the video directly by clicking on to that download button. Then the program will start to analyze. You can also find video-related information like download speed, size, and name of the video during download.

![How to convert and downlaod 4k video in MP4 Format<](https://images.wondershare.com/video-converter-ultimate/guide/download-6.jpg)

Another way to download the 4K videos is by copying video’s URL and pasting it into the URL space given at the above left of the program’s screen. Then the downloading process starts. You should opt for dragging the URL into the program if the file size is huge. Because waiting for the video to load becomes arduous.

Once the process of downloading is complete, double-click on the video from the Download category to play. If the size of the 4K video is huge, try converting it into different formats. So you can easily import it into your other portable devices. You can do this by clicking on the ‘convert’ button which is displayed on the right side.

Or you can check some [free video editing software for mp4 video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).
