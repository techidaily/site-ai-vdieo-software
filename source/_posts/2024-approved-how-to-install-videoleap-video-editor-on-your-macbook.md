Don’t worry – here, I will let you know how to install **Videoleap for MacBook** and would also list its best alternatives.

## Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

* BlueStacks
* Nox Player
* MEmu Player
* ARChon Player

Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.

**Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks**

To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.

![download bluestacks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-2.jpg)

Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.

Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).

![download bluestacks on Mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-3.jpg)

**Step 2: Connect your Google Account on BlueStacks**

Once you have installed BlueStacks on your MacBook, you can launch it, and go to the Google Play app. From here, you can just log in to an active Google account on the BlueStacks app.

![Access Google Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-4.jpg)

**Step 3: Install Videoleap for MacBook via BlueStacks**

That’s it! Once you have configured Google Play, you can just launch it, and look for “Videoleap” from the search bar. After finding the app, you can click on the “Install” button and wait as **Videoleap for MacBook** would be downloaded.
