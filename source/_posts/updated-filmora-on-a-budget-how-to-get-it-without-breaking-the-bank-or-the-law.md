This dedicated software offers its users numerous different features that are aimed at making your video content better. It is widely loved by users for its prestigious and easy-to-use features.

However, much to many people’s dismay, Filmora is not free. But would you like to acquire the **Filmora free** version on your device? Would you like to download the Wondershare Filmora video editor for free and edit videos or photos without paying $49.99 annually?

Another method is for users who have already installed Filmora on their devices. If you are using Filmora, you do not need to crack it in order to get **Filmora free**. You can earn the Filmora license by doing the mission of exporting three videos in total from the software. The method is quite simple and easy, but the mission is only available for Filmora 10.2 and above versions for a limited time. And the mission may be taken down sometime.

In order to do so, you have to follow the steps mentioned below.
