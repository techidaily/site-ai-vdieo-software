The videos you record with your phone need to be edited before you share them on social media. Whether you want to apply a visual effect just to trim the footage, either way, you are going to need a **video editing app** that enables you to perform these tasks.

You don’t necessarily need to install a video editor on your Smartphone or computer if you just want to brush up your videos quickly before you post them, because there is a variety of web-based [online video editing platforms](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that offer all basic video editing tools.

The affordability and the available video editing tools can also play an important role in your decision as they determine how efficiently you can edit a vertically oriented video. Let’s take a look at some of the top six web-based vertical video editors.
