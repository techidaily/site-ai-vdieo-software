### Fix 5: Update DirectX

 DirectX is a suite of components in Windows that allows heavy multimedia apps such as games to interact with your video and audio cards. If you’re running an old version of DirectX, it’s possible that it won’t be able to handle the graphics rendering and processing task, which might cause the Gears of War to crash. So you should update DirectX to the latest version to see if it fixes the issue.

 If you’re not sure which version of DirectX your computer is running, or how to update DirectX, please refer to this **[quick guide](https://tools.techidaily.com/drivereasy/download/)**  .

 Once you’ve updated DirectX, check to see if the game crashes issue is fixed.

 Still not resolved? Please try **Fix 6** , below.
