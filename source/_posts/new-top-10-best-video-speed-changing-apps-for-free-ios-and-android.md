Anyone can convert a WebM video to MP3 with File-Converter-Online because the file conversion process is remarkably easy. All you need to do is choose a file from your hard drive you would like to convert, select MP3 as the output file type and click on the Start Converting button. The download process will start automatically, once the WebM file is converted to MP3, although you won’t be able to store your freshly generated audio file on the cloud directly from this platform. There are no video size limits, which enables you to convert all WebM files regardless of how large or small they are.

This is a simple but efficient file conversion tool that enables you to convert multiple WebM videos at the same time. However, if you are using the free version of the platform you won’t be able to convert more than two WebM files to MP3 simultaneously. Furthermore, the maximum size of a video file you can convert with this platform is limited to just 500MB regardless of the subscription plan you have. Opting for any of the available subscription plans will grant you access to unlimited conversion hours so that you can convert as many WebM videos as you want each day.

The simplest and by far the fastest way to convert a WebM video to an MP3 file on PC and Mac computers is to use the VLC media player. After you installed and launched VLC you should click on the Media menu and select the Convert/Save option.

The Open Media window will pop up on the screen, and you just have to click on the Add button located in the File Selection section of the screen in order to import a WebM video into VLC. Afterward, you should click on the Convert/Save button to gain access to the Convert window. Change the Profile setting to Audio – MP3 and click on the Browse button in the Destination section of the window if you want to choose the location on your hard drive where the converted file is going to be saved. After you click on the Start button, VLC will convert you WebM video to MP3 and place the converted file to the folder you specified.

**Conclusion**

Each video saved in WebM file format can be easily converted into an MP3 audio file you can add to your music library. Online WebM to MP3 converters often have size limits, even if you purchase a subscription. That is why it is much easier and less expensive to install VLC media player on your Mac or PC computer if you want to convert WebM videos to MP3 files frequently. What is your favorite WebM to MP3 converter? Let us know in the comments.
