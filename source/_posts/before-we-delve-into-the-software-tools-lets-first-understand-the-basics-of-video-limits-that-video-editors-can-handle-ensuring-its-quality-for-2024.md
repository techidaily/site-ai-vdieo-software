Recording and cutting unnecessary scenes from a large video is a daily task in video editing. When users require cutting large videos, they are often found researching questions like “how can I edit videos faster?”, “what are the methods to edit large videos without losing their quality?”, “how much time does large video editing takes?” on different forums.

![cut video meme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/cut-video-meme.png)

Understanding the importance of this issue, we decided to elaborate on how to edit large videos faster and lossless by introducing some of the best video editing tools in this article. Before we delve into the software tools, let's first understand the basics of video limits that video editors can handle, ensuring its quality.

* Section1\. [What Size Video Can an Ordinary Video Editor Handle?](#s1)
* Section2\. [Which Software Can Handle Large Videos?](#s2)

## Section 1. What Size Video Can an Ordinary Video Editor Handle?

Videos recorded with iPad, iPhone, or any other iOS device can be larger than individuals expect. If your video limit exceeds your desired social media platform’s size limitations, you can opt for video compression using the editing software tools to meet the standards of the required social platform.

### 1\. For cutting Small or Middle Video Size - Online Editor

Video size limitations vary in every online video editor. Since these are free video editing tools available online, therefore they have restrictions and limitations to edit, download, and export videos. However, they are effective in terms of editing as they maintain the quality of the edited videos.

On the other hand, there are several with different video size limits such ranging from **100MB to 1GB**.

### 2\. For Cutting Large Video Size - Video Editing Software

Video editing software tools are unlike online editors. They have no limited video size

requirements and come with multiple inputs and output formats for video editing with several built-in features.

These video editors guarantee exceptional editing without declining the quality of the original video. Individuals can edit large videos faster and easier. In addition, software editing tools will be more advantageous for quick and high-quality video editing.
