## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

## Part4: Motion Blur Effect in Filmmaking

Motion Blur is one of the essential effects to add when you are making a movie. It exaggerates the motion in a perfect way which is necessary for most action movies. This blur effect is usually the result of something moving quicker than the camera. The more significant the speed difference between the camera filming and the moving object, the more pronounced motion blur will be.

In the majority of the cases, it is best to apply motion blur on background objects than the subjects. For example, motion blur is perfect for the shots in which the camera moves at the same speed as the subject. Although, if the subject is moving faster than the camera, you would want a minimal blur.

Technically speaking, more excellent motion blur can be obtained through a lower shutter speed or vice versa. Ensure that your shutter speed is always twice your framerate because anything lower can result in unnatural-looking footage. The famous bike chase of Star Wars Episode VI is a perfect example of the productive application of motion blur. The scene was captured by walking in the forest and shooting a single frame per time.

## Conclusion

Most of the videos need a significant amount of blur to make them look realistic. FCPX is excellent editing software, but it does not have blurring effects. However, there's a way to add blur effect in FCPX, but many people are unaware of it.

To tackle this problem, we came up with different plugins for Motion Blur and its effects in filmmaking. So, now you have in-depth knowledge of how you can add blur effects in FCPX.

### 1\.  TikTok

**Available for:** Android, iOS, iPad

[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more. The introduction of the reaction feature in Tiktok enables the users to make and share their opinions about a particular event without leaving the application, therefore attracting more users even from other social media platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

![Make Reaction Video with TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-reaction-video-maker-app.jpg)

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option.

You can add filters and [edit the volume level](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and then publish your reaction to the platform as needed.

**Pros**

* TikTok is free to use

The software is available for both Mac computers and iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad and has almost all the features and functions required to edit and manipulate the videos to bring the best out of them.

Although not particularly a reaction video maker app, iMovie can be used to create plenty of them by recording your footage on your smartphone, downloading the source videos from TikTok, transferring both the clips to your Mac computer with iMovie installed (or installing iMovie on your iOS device if you are OK comfortable with the version), doing some basic editing tasks, downloading and importing the pre-keyed effects, adding them to your reaction project, and then exporting the final reaction in your preferred format.

**Pros**

### 1\.  TikTok

**Available for:** Android, iOS, iPad

[TikTok](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/tiktok-make-your-day/id835599320) is a Chinese video-making and sharing social networking application used to create short dances, lip syncs, comedy and talent recordings, and much more. The introduction of the reaction feature in Tiktok enables the users to make and share their opinions about a particular event without leaving the application, therefore attracting more users even from other social media platforms like YouTube, Vimeo, etc.

![Make Reaction Video with TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-reaction-video-maker-app.jpg)

To record a reaction, you can begin playing the video, tap the **Share** icon to open the menu and tap the **React** option. With this, Tiktok presents you with a video creation screen that allows you to add audio, change the position of the reaction box, and then record a video using your smartphone’s rear or front camera. You can add filters and [edit the volume level](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and then publish your reaction to the platform as needed.

**Pros**

* TikTok is free to use
* The app is available for both iOS and Android platforms

**Cons**

* Doesn’t allow videos that are of more than 60 seconds for normal users
* Limited in monetizing currently

### 2\.  iMovie

**Available for:** iOS, iPad and macOS

Developed by and proprietary of Apple Inc., [iMovie](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/imovie/id377298193) is a simple post-production program for amateurs, and in some cases, even for [professional video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The software is available for both Mac computers and iOS devices such as iPhone and iPad and has almost all the features and functions required to edit and manipulate the videos to bring the best out of them.

Although not particularly a reaction video maker app, iMovie can be used to create plenty of them by recording your footage on your smartphone, downloading the source videos from TikTok, transferring both the clips to your Mac computer with iMovie installed (or installing iMovie on your iOS device if you are OK comfortable with the version), doing some basic editing tasks, downloading and importing the pre-keyed effects, adding them to your reaction project, and then exporting the final reaction in your preferred format.

**Pros**

* iMovie is a free program and can be downloaded from the App Store on your Mac computer or iPhone/iPad

**Cons**

* Not a full-fledged post-production program with all the robust features to work with.

Apart from this, you can pause and [rewind clips](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and record commentary videos as well.

**Pros**

* Inbuilt effects and transitions

**Cons**

With iReact, you can record intros as well where the app lets you capture self-introduction before the actual clip. This structure is widely popular among the YouTube community.

As an added advantage, options like replay, pause, resume, rewind, and [fast-forward](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) come in handy as you can perform all these tasks while the camera records your reaction.

**Pros**

* Users can resize and reposition the videos

Because brands look for people with a high number of likes and comments, [Reactoo](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reactoo/id1177583261) acts as a bridge between you and companies by simplifying the process of earning money on the basis of sponsorship.

![Make Reaction Video with Reactoo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/reactoo-app-making-reaction-video.jpg)

With Reactoo, you can also share your reaction videos on social networks like Facebook, Instagram and Twitter. However, although the program is available only for iOS devices like iPhone and iPad, offers a simple interface that allows you to create stunning videos on your mobile devices.
