**An Alternative Way to Cut Large Videos Faster on Mac with Adobe Premiere Pro**

Adobe Premiere Pro is the most used video editing software in all around the world. It can endure very large files and provide a great experience for video editors, facilitating every aspect of video editing. The software works on both Mac and Windows. In case we have large files, we usually turn to Adobe Premiere Pro, so, one of the most important things to do might be to cut large videos faster there. Actually, it is something not at all difficult – the steps are as follows: first, you need to import your footage and add it to the sequence (referred also as timeline, to the long horizontal window below);

then, you don’t need to do anything there, just open the export settings (the shortcut for which would be ctrl+m),

and reduce the size;

and finally, you need to click on export button to compress the video if this is already the result that you needed.
