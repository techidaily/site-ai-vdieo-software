Developed by Lightricks Studio, Videoleap is one of the most powerful video editors, which is available for iOS and Android devices. While you can directly install Videoleap on your iPhone or Android phone by visiting its App/Play Store page, you won’t find its desktop application. That’s why a lot of people find it hard to install Videoleap on their macOS systems. Don’t worry – here, I will let you know how to install **Videoleap for MacBook** and would also list its best alternatives.

* [**Part 1: Major Features of Videoleap**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook**](#part3)

## Part 1: Major Features of Videoleap

You might already know that Videoleap is a popular smartphone app that is used for video editing on iOS and Android devices. It is a part of the Lightricks Creative Suite that would let you create, edit, and share your videos in one place.

![Videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-1.jpg)

* You can find all kinds of basic editing options in Videoleap to crop, trim, rotate, or flip your videos.
* Videoleap provides a layer-based editing interface that would let you work on videos, images, audio tracks, and other media content.
* There are hundreds of visual effects (like transitions, stickers, filters, etc.) that you can readily use in Videoleap.
* Some of the other smart features of Videoleap would be green screen edits, prism effects, sound editing, and so on.

## Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

* BlueStacks
* Nox Player
* MEmu Player
* ARChon Player

Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.

**Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks**

To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.

![download bluestacks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-2.jpg)

Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.

Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).

![download bluestacks on Mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-3.jpg)

**Step 2: Connect your Google Account on BlueStacks**

Once you have installed BlueStacks on your MacBook, you can launch it, and go to the Google Play app. From here, you can just log in to an active Google account on the BlueStacks app.

![Access Google Account](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-4.jpg)

**Step 3: Install Videoleap for MacBook via BlueStacks**

That’s it! Once you have configured Google Play, you can just launch it, and look for “Videoleap” from the search bar. After finding the app, you can click on the “Install” button and wait as **Videoleap for MacBook** would be downloaded.

![Install Videoleap](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-5.jpg)

After Videoleap is installed on BlueStacks, you can launch it, and start editing your videos without any hassle.

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook

As you can see, installing **Videoleap for a MacBook** can be a tedious job as it is only available for smartphones. Therefore, instead of using an emulator to install Videoleap, you can consider using the following video editors on your Mac.

### 1\. [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is one of the best video editing apps that is super-easy to use and fully supports all the major macOS versions. It is a multi-timeline [macOS video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that would let you apply all kinds of edits and use tons of visual effects to make your content look appealing.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

* _User-friendly Video Editing_

You can load clips, images, audio files, and other media content on different timelines of the editor. It provides instant solutions to crop, trim, rotate, flip, and do all the other edits in a user-friendly way.

* _AI-Integrated Features_

Wondershare Filmora has also included highly advanced Artificial Intelligence and Augmented Reality features. For instance, with its AI Portrait Mode, you can detect a human face on the video and instantly remove its background. There are also tons of AR stickers that you can just drag and drop to your videos.

* _Tons of Video Effects_

On Filmora, you can also explore hundreds of video transitions, overlays, filters, stickers, and numerous other effects. You can readily add captions and other text effects to your videos as well.

* _Sound Effects_

Apart from video editing, you can also edit the added soundtracks in your videos. Using Filmora, you can add voiceovers to your videos and apply effects like fade in/out, denoise, audio ducking, and so on.

* _Other Features_

Furthermore, Filmora offers some of the most advanced video editing effects for Mac such as Auto Reframe, color tuning, pan-and-zoom, green screen, video stabilization, and so much more.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### 2\. iMovie

Lastly, if you are looking for a freely available alternative for **Videoleap for MacBook**, then you can try iMovie. The video editor is developed by Apple and is already installed in leading Mac systems. While it doesn’t offer so many extensive features, iMovie would meet your basic video editing needs.

![iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/videoleap-for-macbook-7.jpg)

* _Ready-made Templates_

On iMovie, you can find several professionally made templates that you can simply load and customize to create videos.

* _Sound Effects_

Besides editing your videos, you can also add sound effects to your projects, and edit them as per your preferences.

* _All Basic Editing Features_

Once the video is loaded on its timeline, iMovie will let you perform all the basic edits such as clip, trim, crop, rotate, flip, and so on.

* _Other Features_

A few advanced features of iMovie are green screen edits, tons of transitions and filters, 4K video editing, caption effects, and other optimized features for Mac.

## Final Words

There you go! I’m sure that after following this guide, you can easily use **Videoleap for MacBook.** Since Videoleap is only available for iOS and Android devices, I have come up with a stepwise approach to install it on Mac. Though, instead of Videoleap, you can consider using Wondershare Filmora on your MacBook. It is a far better and more user-friendly video editor for Mac that has some of the most advanced features.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Those new to the Final Cut Pro or Pro X programs will be finding it a little challenging to [add effects](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or edit videos. It’s a complex film editing software that takes a while to use. With our help, however, we can have you mastering the Ken Burns effect in Final Cut Pro. Do you want to know how to make ken burns effect in final cut pro? Listen closely.

* [**Part 1: How to Make Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro**](#Make-Ken-Burns-Effect)
* [**Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing**](#Zoom-in-Final-Cut-Pro-Keyframing)

## Part 1: How to Make Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro

To make a Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro X (or a Ken Burns Effect on Final Cut, since they are both extensions of one another) simply follow our guide.

First, let’s talk about what Ken Burns is and why he has an effect named after him in Final Cut programs!

### What is the Ken Burns Effect

[Ken Burns](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken%5FBurns%5Feffect) is a world-famous American documentary filmmaker. He is well known for producing documentaries that take a candid if somewhat old-world-feeling look into different worlds. He has covered Baseball, the Civil War, and other fascinating times and places. Arguably, he is best known for using archival footage as film footage. How does he do this? By using the Ken Burns Effect, of course.

The Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X allows the editor to zoom in and out, slow pan, and scroll across archive photography and still film. This will enable you to substitute whole parts of the program you are making with photographs if you haven’t taken enough footage. It is commonly used in editing, particularly when making things like [wedding videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which often feature lots of photos of the happy couple.

Anyway, let’s look at how you implement the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.

### Steps to Making the Ken Burns Effect Final Cut Pro

Now that we know what is Ken Burns Effect. Let’s go over the steps to making the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro.

**Step 1** – Import your video. From your timeline workspace, select the clip, or highlight the section of the clip, that you want to apply the Ken Burns Effect to.

![import media](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/import-media-final-cut-pro.JPG)

**Step 2** – Enter into the viewer mode to do this. From here, select the pop-up menu from the list of options at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3** – Hold down both the shift key and the letter C. This is the fast way to cut out what you need. You can always stick to the right-click to cut a clip if you are more comfortable with this.

**Step 4** – scroll down until you find the Ken Burns Effect option in the control panel. The effect should now appear on your page, in the area you selected.

### Ken Burns Customization

You can also customize the ken burns effects in Final Cut.

**Step 1** – To transform from the Ken Burns Effect into customization mode, drag the green box in the viewer.

**Step 2** – Adjust the green box’s size, shape, and height until you are happy with where it is placed.

![customize ken burns effects](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/customize-ken-burns-effects-box.JPG)

**Step 3** – Checking what you have already put in place using the preview option is a good idea at this stage. You can edit mistakes out later, but when you are trying to edit for speed, it is best to get it right the first time around!

**Step 4** – Adjust the viewer to accommodate any changes you need to make – don’t click the done button until you are sure. That being said, you can always back-step should you mis-click. You can also just start over with the effect customization if you messed up.

## Part 2: How to Zoom in Final Cut Pro Using Keyframing

Now that we know how to open and apply the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro. Let’s examine how we zoom in Final Cut Pro using keyframing. Keyframing, of course, involves [basic animation](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that allows movement to be added to a still frame. So how do you use the Ken Burns Effect in Final Cut Pro X in conjunction with keyframing? Let’s talk you through it.

You can use keyframing to zoom and pan. We will talk you through how you use it to zoom in, and you should be able to work out the rest from there.

**Step 1** – Set the playhead at the start of the chosen clip. This is where you want the zoom effect to start from.

**Step 2** – Click to select the effects menu. It should be at the bottom of the screen.

**Step 3** – Seek out the scale and position tools. You can use these to size your animation, decide how much of a zoom you like, and how fast it will go.

![scale and position](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmorapro/scale-and-position-final-cut.jpg)

**Step 4** – Follow keyframe > size > position and ensure your clip is covered as you need it. You can always come back to this step a few times if you don’t get it immediately right.

**Step 5** – Set the playhead where you want the clip and animation to end. Remember – if you zoom or pan too fast, you might glitch in your footage. Do it on time for the best results.

**As a Pro Tip**: you will be baled to view all keyframes on your clip if you select show video animation from your timeline.

## The Ken Burns Conclusion

The Ken Burns Effect is famous for a reason. It allows you to fill up space if you don’t have footage for certain things. It can be used to depict ancient battles without the use of CGI.

The Ken Burns Effect, Final Cut Pro (X) technique lets filmmakers go to places that they wouldn’t otherwise get to. It is excellent for both glimpsing into the past, and for flashing forward into imagined futures. Best of all, it lets you go there when you aren’t a big-budget Hollywood film producer. We love anything that saves a buck or two while we edit.

Although it might seem similar to cut operation, jump cuts are preferable by YouTubers and vloggers. Here is a guide to teach **how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro** with markers.

**Step 1: Create a fresh project and import media files**

Launch the Final Cut Pro X app, and once opened, create a new project by executing "File > New > Project". Type the name of your project or video, and press "**OK**".

Now, you can start to import the video file to add the jump cuts.

**Step 2: Add markers**

Bring the video into the timeline, and play the video. To add markers before creating jump cuts on the timeline, bring the pointer to the clip where you need to divide it into segments and press "**M**".

A blue marker will be on the video timeline. Similarly, you can place markers on places wherever required.

**Step 3: Apply jump cuts**

Lastly, to apply quick jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro, tap the speed icon from the timeline where you will get various options from which you need to click the “**Jump Cuts at Markers**” option.

You can specify the frame range based on which the jump cuts will get executed in the video.

Thus, this is **how to do jump cuts in the Final Cut Pro** by speeding up the clips based on frames hence helping the action happen in just a fraction of seconds.

## Part 2: How to Fix a Jump Cut in Final Cut Pro X?

If you do jump cuts with markers in FCPX, you do not need to fix it, but if you opt for the other way of cut and delete, you must set them for a smoother process. Let's take a look at **how to fix a jump cut** by transition addition.

**Step 1**. After importing your media files, perform jump cuts by following the previous section.

**Step 2**. To fix jump cuts, place the pointer on the clip, and tap the transition icon from the timeline menu with various options. Primarily "**Flow**" transition option is used in FCPX.

Tap any option, and Final Cut Pro X will automatically apply it to the clip.

## Part 3: How to Hide Jump Cuts in Final Cut Pro X?

Want to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X? Then, here is the session to know **how to hide jump cuts** in FCPX with two options: resizing the video clip and synchronizing clips.

**Method 1: Resizing the clip**

To do this method, select a clip. It could be the first one or the latter. Now, click on the “Resize” icon.

You can resize the clip using the circle resize option near the video preview or the “Scale” option on the right corner.

Doing so will add effects to the video clip hiding the jump cuts added.

**Method 2: Synchronizing clips**

Another way to hide jump cuts in Final Cut Pro X is to synchronize the clip with the other relevant clip.

You can add another video to the timeline and place it where you created the jump cut.

When you prefer this method, you have to ensure that the synchronized video's audio is on mute to avoid disturbing the actual one.
