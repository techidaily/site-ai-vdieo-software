 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

It is hard to believe that in 2024 Google Play had just fifty apps since it currently offers 2.8 million applications that can be used for anything from photo and [video editing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to learning a new language.

This year Google Play had a difficult task of selecting the best app of 2024, as there are so many apps across different categories that are worthy of this award. On December 3rd Google Play announced its choice and also presented the best Android apps of 2024 that were selected by users. So without further ado let’s take a look at the best and most popular Android apps of 2024

## The Best App of 2024 Selected by Google Play: [Ablo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=live.ablo&hl=en)

Language barriers can prevent us from exploring the world and experiencing different cultures. So, it is no wonder that an app that enables its users to talk to people from around the globe in their mother tongue was chosen as the best app of 2024 by Google Play.

![ 
Ablo: Make new friends from all over the world ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ablo-chat-app-best-app-google-play.jpg)

Ablo translates all chat messages in real-time which enables you to talk with all likeminded people you meet even if you don’t speak the same language.

The app also translates video calls live and allows you to have meaningful conversations with friends that come from different parts of the world. If you are traveling often and looking for an easy way to encounter the local culture or you just want to communicate with people whose language you don’t understand, then you should install Ablo and start making friends around the world.

## The Most Popular Apps of 2024 on Google Play

Smartphones bring entertainment to the palms of our hands and grant us instant access to information that makes our lives easier. Over the course of 2024 apps from a broad range of categories have sparked the interest of thousands of Android users. Here are some of the most popular apps of 2024 that can help you improve your productivity or make better fashion choices.

### 1\. [Peloton](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.onepeloton.callisto&hl=en)

**Category:**Health & Fitness

![InShot Video Editor - Glitch Video Effects ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/peloton-most-popular-app-android.jpg)

Leading a healthy lifestyle is much easier if you have the assistance of the world’s leading instructors. If you already own a Peloton bike or tread, then you can enjoy all the benefits of the Peloton app for free. Yoga, cardio or indoor cycling are just a few among numerous types of classes you can attend through this Android app. In addition, you can also broadcast your workouts through the Peloton’s Chromecast support and share your daily workout routines with thousands of followers. Even so, the app’s interface is somewhat outdated and the app crashes easily during workouts, which makes using Peloton frequently a bit difficult.
