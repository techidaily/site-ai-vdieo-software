Canon camcorders consistently rank among the best camcorder models available to consumers, achieving high marks for image quality, convenience and advanced features. Their superior performance ensures Canon's popularity, even as most smartphones include video recording options.

Canon camcorder owners typically want the ability to edit, adjust and add special effects to their videos. There are a variety of Canon camcorder video editing software solutions, as well as online applications, that offer varying levels of performance and features.

One factor limiting the software or applications used to edit Canon camcorder videos is format: some models only record in .mov format, or among a limited selection of supported formats. Some Canon camcorders have poor performance in low-light situations, requiring adjustment in editing. Color accuracy may also need fixing with video editing software.

## Tips for choosing Canon Camcorder Video Editing Software

How do you choose the right Canon camcorder video editing software? Here are some brief tips to ensure you get the right software to meet your needs:

#### 1.What is your budget?

There are numerous free video editing tools available, although with performance or feature limitations. Do you have the budget to support a paid program that offers advanced features?

#### 2\. Do you need novice accessibility or professional-level performance?

Many free video editing programs that are available online are easy to use and have more than enough capability for novice users. Professional-grade features are only available with paid programs.

#### 3\. What are your format requirements?

A video editing program that supports .mov format is a requirement in almost all circumstances. Check the format your Canon camera records in, as well as the formats you want to create output files and find video editing software that supports both.

Like the Ubersense Coach, Coach's Eye exists for sports-driven individuals who want to have a technical, slow-motion video of their training and practices. Capture your sports videos, use its zoom function and instantly review its slow-motion playback with drawing tools. You could draw on the videos, encircle things, use freehand tools and even add audio commentaries. However, the tools are not included in the Free version of this app.

Place videos side-to-side for further analysis and refine your sports techniques.

Lucky Clan's slow motion app has garnered the hearts of its iOs users. When the Slow Motion button is tapped, you can record a high frame rate slow motion video with a smooth transition from the normal sequence. Focus and exposure points can be easily adjusted, and you could record your next slow motion video while the previous one is being rendered.

Remember that the frame rate is dependent on the iOs devices. That's 120 fps for the iPhone 5s+, 60 fps for the iPhone5/5c and iPad mini, and 30 fps on the other Apple devices.

Game Your Video is an iOs app developed by Global Delight. This easy-to-use app can integrate live motion effects, which you could apply while playing. You could also choose video filters or use the reverse feature for a dramatic impact. Put in some games into your videos by slow mo-ing them.

To make your slow-mo video even cooler, you can add audio effects like altered voices or a custom soundtrack from your library.
