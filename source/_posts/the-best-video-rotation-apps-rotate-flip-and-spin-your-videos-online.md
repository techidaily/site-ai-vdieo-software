 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Until recently, horizontally oriented videos were one of the rare undisputed industry standards, but with the rapid advancement of phone cameras and social media networks that support vertically oriented videos, a growing number of people need to rotate their videos. It is important to note that if you choose to rotate a video, the results you are going to get maybe underwhelming, to say the least, because the video’s aspect ratio is going to remain the same. The process of rotating a video is rather simple, and you don’t need access to a professional video editing app like Adobe Premiere Pro to perform this task, because there are quite a few online platforms you can use to rotate your videos online.

## Rotate Video with Animation in Wondershare Filmora on Windows and Mac

Wondershare Filmora is a widely used video editor for YouTubers on the market. In the latest Filmora version, you can add animation to rotation, and make the video rotation animated.
