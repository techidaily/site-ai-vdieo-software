You should select an efficient and eye-catching color scheme for your lyric video. That is because it is helpful in elevating the visual appeal of the video, which in turn gains the attention of the viewers.

**Fonts**

A lyric video is all about fonts because the viewers are interested in reading the lyrics. So, you should select interesting fonts and should focus on font style, size, and color. The fonts should sync in with the video’s vibe so that the viewer can enjoy watching it.

**Transitions/Filters**

You should use filters that could blend with the song’s vibe. Choose the transitions that look natural and appealing. Never bombard your video with too many transitions and filters.

## Part 3: Popular Lyric Videos on YouTube

Here are some of the popular lyric videos:

### **1\.** **The Chainsmokers & Coldplay - Something Just Like This (Lyric)**

This lyric video has been uploaded by The Chainsmokers, where three font colors have been used in the video. Every line of the song consists of a different transition. The song lyrics appear with the audio as the visuals and audio sync with each other. The transitions like pencil drawing are used in this video.

### **2\.** **Taylor Swift - The Man (Lyric Video)**

This lyric video uploaded by Taylor Swift consists of animated characters. The lyrics of this song do not appear as subtitles in the movies, but the lyrics appear on the whole screen. The lyrics match the audio and the music. Capital letters have been used for the lyrics, and the video has been created using Vevo software.

### **3\.** **Justin Timberlake - Suit & Tie (Official Lyric Video) ft. JAY Z**

This lyric video consists of a black and white background video of the song. The lyrics sync in with the song and match the vibe of the song. Some other visuals like music playing through the piano, smoke, etc., are also included. Capital letters have been used for writing the lyrics.
