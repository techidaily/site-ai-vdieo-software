#### 17\. [CyberLink PowerDirector](https://www.cyberlink.com/products/powerdirector-ultra/features%5Fen%5FUS.html)

**Price:**Free trial, Paid version: $69,99 - $129,99

**Level:** Semi-pros

![cyberlink powerdirector](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector.jpg)

This is probably one of the best and most popular video editing software packages aimed at amateur and semi-professional users. There are several versions of the software available, and each of them contains a different amount of options and video editing tools. Even with somewhat reduced capability, the least expensive version of the editor supports 360-degree as well as VR options for posting on social media such as Vimeo, Facebook or YouTube. CyberLink PowerDirector isn't a professional video editing software, but it still offers a lot of extraordinary options that can take you a step closer to producing a professional video.

**Features:** The 360-degree video editing options are probably the first thing that catches the eye when you look at the list of features the software provides, but its true power lies in its color tools. LUTs, HDR effects or Split Toning options are just the tip of the iceberg since PowerDirector offers countless tools for fine-tuning of the colors in your videos. Animated PIP effects and video collages make this video editing software a perfect choice for the production of tutorials and all other types of online videos.

**Advantages:** The audio editing options provided by CyberLink PowerDirector are nothing short of amazing since they enable the software's users to manipulate the audio files in any way they see fit.

**Limitations:** Motion tracking and color lookup features are not always reliable. The software is a bit overpriced when compared with similar video editing suits.

Magix has been the largest European video editing software manufacturer for more than two decades.

The video editing tools supplied by the Magix Video Pro are as impressive as its audio editing options. Lens correction features, Split screen videos or 360-degree video editing options reveal only a fraction of the software's capabilities.

**Level:** Semi-pros

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kinemaster-green-screen.jpg)

This cross-platform video editor is one of the premier options for mobile video editing on both iOS and Android devices. KineMaster is currently the only app that enables Android Smartphone owners to add as many layers of videos, photos, and text to their projects as they want. However, it only supports a limited number of video file formats, which means that the app shouldn't be used to edit videos that weren't recorded on an iPhone or Android phone. KineMaster provides a wide range of video exporting options and allows you to share videos on popular social media networks.

**Pros:** Above average video and audio editing features.

**Limitations:** Offers a lot of options mobile video editors seldom use.

**Level:** Semi-pros

Creating neatly organized projects with LumaFusion is a simple task because the app features a powerful Project Manager that lets you sort files or select aspect ratios for your videos. In addition, the Media Library lets you import all types of files from a cloud storage or drag and drop media from other apps. Producing slow-motion videos that have 120 or 240fps or creating green screen videos using the Chroma Key effect is easy with LumaFusion. The app's audio editing features are as impressive as its video editing tools since they provide the complete control over the audio files to the video editor's users.

**Advantages:** Color correction options, LUTs or numerous visual effects are all part of the reason why LumaFusion is one of the best apps for mobile video editing.

**Limitations:** Only available for iOS devices.

#### 33\. [Vizzywig 2019 4K Video Editor](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/vizzywig-2017-4k-video-editor/id913424818?mt=8)

This award-winning app for iOS devices provides all the tools a skilled video editor could desire. Its features include support for 4K videos, wide selection of aspect ratios as well as stylish intros, end credits, and titles. Besides offering professional video editing tools, Vizzywig also features Multi-Camera recording options that can capture videos in 8K resolution. In addition, the app is capable of producing videos that have eight times more pixels than the Apple's Facetime HD Camera. The non-linear timeline lets you arrange video clips in any way you see fit, and allows you to add multiple media files to each project you are working on.

**Advantages:** Lets you control the focus and exposure manually and produce videos with stunning picture quality.

**Limitations:** Single platform compatibility and a high price narrow down the number of the app's potential users.

#### 34\. [PowerDirector](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cyberlink.powerdirector.DRA140225%5F01)

**Platform:** Android

**Price:** Freemium, contains ads and in-app purchases

**Level:** Beginners

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powerdirector-for-android.jpg)

Unlike the Adobe's app for mobile video editing, PowerDirector lives up to all expectations. This user-friendly app lets you create reverse, 4K, or green screen videos. To make things even better, you can easily apply visual and audio effects or add voiceovers to your projects. In addition to the video editor, the PowerDirector app is also equipped with a powerful photo editor that lets you manipulate images in a professional manner. You can use almost any type of video or audio file in this app because it provides support for all commonly used file formats.

**Advantages:** PowerDirector is designed to help its users polish their video quickly and effortlessly.

**Limitations:** Videos in 1080p and 4K resolutions can only be exported after you've made an in-app purchase.

Ooops…It looks like there isn't any tool that matches your demand. Please give it another try.

Creating neatly organized projects with LumaFusion is a simple task because the app features a powerful Project Manager that lets you sort files or select aspect ratios for your videos. In addition, the Media Library lets you import all types of files from a cloud storage or drag and drop media from other apps. Producing slow-motion videos that have 120 or 240fps or creating green screen videos using the Chroma Key effect is easy with LumaFusion. The app's audio editing features are as impressive as its video editing tools since they provide the complete control over the audio files to the video editor's users.

**Advantages:** Color correction options, LUTs or numerous visual effects are all part of the reason why LumaFusion is one of the best apps for mobile video editing.

**Limitations:** Only available for iOS devices.

This award-winning app for iOS devices provides all the tools a skilled video editor could desire. Its features include support for 4K videos, wide selection of aspect ratios as well as stylish intros, end credits, and titles. Besides offering professional video editing tools, Vizzywig also features Multi-Camera recording options that can capture videos in 8K resolution. In addition, the app is capable of producing videos that have eight times more pixels than the Apple's Facetime HD Camera. The non-linear timeline lets you arrange video clips in any way you see fit, and allows you to add multiple media files to each project you are working on.

**Advantages:** Lets you control the focus and exposure manually and produce videos with stunning picture quality.

**Limitations:** Single platform compatibility and a high price narrow down the number of the app's potential users.

In addition to the video editor, the PowerDirector app is also equipped with a powerful photo editor that lets you manipulate images in a professional manner. You can use almost any type of video or audio file in this app because it provides support for all commonly used file formats.

**Advantages:** PowerDirector is designed to help its users polish their video quickly and effortlessly.

**Limitations:** Videos in 1080p and 4K resolutions can only be exported after you've made an in-app purchase.
