You can use the app to pose five existing characters in a 3D environment, with the controls being highly intuitive and efficient. Many people are drawn to this app because of its simplicity.

The app has been designed by leading character animators, and you can start animating within just a few minutes once you have downloaded it. Full body animation is possible thanks to the advanced articulation on offer, and you can sketch out key poses with the drawing tool.

The onion skin feature will help you plan out poses and time in a precise manner, and you can easily upload your work to a plethora of online platforms, including Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube. There are more than 30 points of articulation, and you can also import audio with ease.

**Pros:**

* Easy to use interface in Anim8
* You can sketch your key poses every time

**Cons:**

* Sometimes you can share your 3D animation
* Not all characters are free to use

## Part 3: FAQ about 3D Animation Apps

### 1\. What is the best app for animation?

For the 3D animation app, we suggest using the Bot3D Editor. It is an easy-to-use anime editor that only needs dragging to complete your editing. If you know how to use keyframes, it will give you more control over animation. For example, you can make poses in many ways by keyframes.

### 2\. How do you animate a 3D object?

The best way to animate a 3D object is by using keyframes and built-in templates. As a beginner, you may not know how to make a 3D object, but with templates, you just need to choose one and start customizing it.

### 3\. Where can I animate for free?

There are so many free-to-use animation software to use. Pencil2D is a reliable tool to make animation easy. You just need to download it on the desktop to animate objects. However, it'd be best if you have a basic understanding of how to make animation. Otherwise, you may need some time to learn it first.

## Conclusion

3D animation apps are ideal for those wishing to learn new skills and heighten their creativity. No matter what you’re looking for, we’re confident that you’ll find an app that meets your needs above. You can also use leading tools such as [Filmora](https://filmorago.onelink.me/4M4O/34b09bf4) to edit your video and add extra effects to add an extra touch of magic to your work.
