##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below. But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly. If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

## Top 10+ Best Free Online Video Editors

Though some online video editing tools listed below provide free trial versions, if you need to download the video, you may need to upgrade your free plan to the paid version. And some free versions will leave a watermark on your video footage in 480p quality. So, please pay attention to it before you dive into this online platform. Please note the online video editors listed are in no particular order.

### #2\. ClipChamp

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Clipchamp is a well-known **free online video editing tool**, besides the video editing tools, it **provides a video compressor, converter, and webcam recorder** as well. The best part is that its **intuitive** work platform allows beginners to complete their video editing within very little time and the output can be directly saved on the computer or shared to Google Drive etc.

Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation. However, if you add a logo to your footage, you may need to upgrade to the Paid version.

You can select **different aspect ratios** such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides **a built-in guide** so you can make a video with it easily. However, you **need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account** first before using this **all-in-one online video editor**. And the free version is **limited to export at the 480P SD** resolution with **no watermark**. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the **video footage can’t be exported in 4K**. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

Not only will it allow you to publish videos in a matter of minutes, but it also gives you access to a library that contains 2.5 million videos and stock images, classified in sectors such as business, background, holiday, food, sports, etc.

With FlexClip, you can easily overlay text on your sequences, attracting attention with elegant fonts and impressive effects, and you can also incorporate smooth transitions between clips.

WeVideo is a shared online video creation tool. You can **upload your own videos, photos, music files** from your computer or from social sites such as Google Drive, Facebook, Box, Instagram, Dropbox, etc. to the Media panel, or use the **built-in stock videos, audio, and images** to make a video quickly. However, the stock images, videos, and audio files are limited to Professional and Business plans, you can also choose to use free music and sound effects instead of Premium music.

Besides the **basic trimming and splitting**, WeVideo allows you to **add markers** to the specific clip, static simple text, and callouts to the video, or transitions, background graphics, overlays, or frames. You can also download the WeVideo on your iPhone, Android phones, and Windows10 computer as well if you prefer to edit videos offline.

If you subscribed to the **paid version**, you can use the premium editing features such as green screen, voiceover, slow motion, screencasting and sync across iOS, Android, and web platforms, and more features.

Though WeVideo says it supports 4K resolution, 4K UHD is only supported on Unlimited ($9.99/mo), Professional ($19.99/mo), and Business ($39.99/mo) plans, and Besides, there are so **many limitations for the free plan**, like you can only publish 5 min/month and the max video resolution is 480P. Besides, **there will be a watermark** in the right upper corner of the video in the Free plan. The same as using Clip Champ, you **need to sign in** before using the WeVideo online video editor.

### #5\. Wideo

![Wideo Online Animated Video Editor Editing Panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wideo-online-animated-video-maker.jpg)

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

However, if you want to **download** the video on your computer, you’ll **need to upgrade your plan**. If you want to use your own footage and save the edited videos on your desk, Wideo isn't a free option for you.

### #6\. PowToon

![Wideo Online Animated Video Editor Editing Panel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/powtoon-online-animated-video-maker.jpg)

PowToon is a great way to create videos that will serve an explanatory purpose. If you need a video that is to serve as a sort of guide or teacher then PowToon is definitely the website you want to use. It allows you to use what is essentially a digital version of paper cut-outs superimposed on colorful backgrounds. The drag and drop style editing leaves you with a video reminiscent of the Common Craft style.

You **need to sign in** to use this online, and it provides **many video templates** available for different situations such as explainer video, marketing video, infographic video, video ads, and presentation. It also allows you to **create 1:1 square, 16:9 horizontal, and 9:16 vertical videos**, you can **upload your own video footage** or use the built-in video sources from Storyblocks. You can choose to select one of PowToon's many drawings of people and objects, which you can then arrange on a blank canvas or on a colorful background of your choice.

The free version will also **leave a Powtoon branding watermark** on your export video and you can export video up to 3 mins in HD quality, and you can’t download the video as MP4 too.

### #7\. Video Toolbox

![Video Toolbox Online  Video Editor](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-toolbox-online-video-editor-interface.jpg)

Touted as the future of video editing, Video Toolbox is a free online platform that in addition to editing your video files analyses it and gives you highly detailed information about the bit rate, codec, frame rate, and resolution.

It can also **convert** your video file to the most popular video formats such as MKV, MOV, MP4, and AVI. This online platform allows you to upload videos from a computer or from a URL, it can now handle video files up to 1500MB and that still gives you a lot to play around with, and you can **merge, crop, or cut video** files. The editing features are **simple and limited** but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.

You need to **sign up** and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is **outdated and not user-friendly** enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be **no real-time preview window** to check the editing progress.

Go to [Video Toolbox Online Video Editor Platform >>](http://www.videotoolbox.com/)

### #8\. Kizoa

![Kizoa online movie maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Kizoa is well recognized for its wide set of transition effects and that can assist you to develop professional style videos with ease. You can make a video on Kizoa with photos, videos, and music, add text, special effects, music, and transitions to polish the clip. Kizoa also **supports 4K UHD footage** and provides **different aspect ratios** such as 16:9, 4:3, 3:2, 1:1, and 9:16, 3:4, and 2:3 portrait formats. You can **add videos and photos from your computer** or from social media accounts like Facebook.

But if you need to download or share the video, you still need to register.

There is **no timeline**, you just need to add your photos and video footage to the storyboard at the bottom, click the Play button to preview the result. Every time you select an effect, Kizoa will indicate how to do it next, which makes it **easier for beginners**. But there **will be a watermark in the Free plan**, and the exported video is limited to 720P, and you need to upgrade to the paid plan to remove the watermark.

Hippo Video is an all-in-one video marketing platform that also provides video editing tools. You can add your media files from a computer or from Google Drive, but as it is claimed that video formats are **limited to mp4, Mkv, Flv, 3gp, and mpg,** and the supported **maximum video file is 500MB**, and you can only add one video at importing. Besides importing videos, you can also use Hippo Video to record your desktop screen, webcam, and voiceover.

The free version does provide **some basic editing features** such as split, trim, crop, add text or resize, and add simple titles, emojis, and callouts, but if you want to do some professional editing, you may **need to** **recommend it to your friends** or **upgrade your account.**

You **need to register** for this online platform first before editing. And there is no video footage nor stock music available (maybe it is hidden in the Pro editing mode). You can **share the video** directly to social media platforms such as FB, Twitter, YouTube, or via email. You can also **download the clip** to your desk. NO watermark in Free Plan.

Magisto is a great online video maker that is really popular for automatically turning what would otherwise be an everyday type video into a beautiful poignant movie and outstanding social videos. It is user-friendly and very quick with all the tools you'd expect from software you hocked your kidney to buy.

After **signing up** with your FB or G+ account, you can **add photos and videos** to Magisto also provides various **video templates** which cover different industries such as Birthday wishes, Wedding, promotion, announce and inspiration.

Magisto is a **cross-platform** which means you can use it on Mobile devices, tablets, and the web, just use the same account and you can access your videos on all devices. You can share the video to social media platforms directly, but if you want to save the videos to a computer, you need to upgrade your plan or invite friends to get the free download.

### #11\. Kapwing

![kapwing online video studio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Kapwing provides lots of **online video editing related products** such as online meme generator, video maker, video resizer, and video trimmer, add subtitles, add audio and loop video, as well as an all-in-one online video studio. This  lets you **combine videos, GIFs, and photos, add texts and audio** to create a brand new video.

To editing videos, just **upload your media** file from the computer or **paste the video URL** to start. Kapwing  allows you to **customize the output video size** in 1:1, 9:16, 16:9, 4:5, or 5:4, do some **basic editing** such as trim, crop, change speed or mute audio.

### #12\. Online Video Cutter

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Though it isn't a video editor to some degree, this intuitive online video editing tool application appears user-friendly and it isn’t limited to cut videos as the name indicates. You can upload videos from computer or via Dropbox, Google Drive or URL directly. With this online video cutter, you can easily **rotate** the videos to 90, 180 or even 270 degrees, **crop** them, **trim** or apply several professional style editing features to create incredible projects. You can **save the video with the original quality or to 1080P Full HD**.

It can easily handle the **maximum file size of 500MB** and allow users to access any popular media file format with ease. It is free to use and you can access all advanced features even without buying any license.

What I like about this online video editing tool is that **you don’t need to register to use** it and there is also **no watermark** in the saved video. But it would be greater if this online tool can integrate some music and effects as well.

[Visit Online Video Cutter >>](http://online-video-cutter.com/)

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.
