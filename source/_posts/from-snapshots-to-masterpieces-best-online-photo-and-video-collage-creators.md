## Best Online Video Collage Makers \[Free & Paid\]

Platforms that exclusively offer **video collage-making** services are rare, and in most cases, you have to use a [web-based video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) if you want to create video collages online.

In addition, the video editing platforms that do provide the video collage feature, offer only a limited amount of video editing tools, which is the reason why it is still better to use [video editing software for PC](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or Mac computers if you want to make video collages professionally. However, there are still a few online destinations where you can combine several videos with ease.

#### 1. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/collage)

Guided Edits, which walk the user step-by-step through multiple things, is a fundamental component of Elements. It is supported by Windows

They help learn the ropes and gain confidence thanks to the user-friendly design. The current version of Premiere Elements has received some under-the-hood improvements, depending less on the CPU and more on the graphics card to improve results.
