You can convert MP4, m4v, amr, MPEG files formats among numerous others to MP3, FLAC, WAV, OGG, and other audio file formats. All conversions take place on a cloud server, which means that you canâ€™t use The Audio Converter while your iPhone is offline. Keep in mind that the free version of the app offers only limited functionalities and you must purchase either Premium Pass or Lifetime Pass if you want to use it to convert MP4 to MP3 on a constant basis.

#### 3. [Video to MP3 â€“ Convert Audio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-convert-audio/id1400653079)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter  for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-converter-audio-extractor.jpg)

Converting a video saved on your phoneâ€™s camera roll to MP3 with the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor requires you to just select a file and start the conversion process. You wonâ€™t even have to specify the output format, because MP3 is the appâ€™s default output format. After the conversion, you can listen to the file you created to make sure that its quality is at a satisfying level. However, you wonâ€™t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 youâ€™re generating. Moreover, the app offers only modest file-sharing options, and you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to gain access to all features the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor has to offer.
