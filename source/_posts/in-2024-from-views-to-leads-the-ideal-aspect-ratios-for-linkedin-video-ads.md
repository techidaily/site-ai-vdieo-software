**Sponsored messages in LinkedIn:** This type of LinkedIn ad was previously termed as sponsored InMail. Through this, you can directly advertise your product or brand in the user’s inbox. However, LinkedIn has set a maximum number of times that your customer can receive the messaging ad.

Also, it is estimated that consumers enjoy messaging ads but companies do not interact much with them via sponsored messaging ads.

This makes them different from the regular contents. If you are choosing sponsored content then you also get the choice between carousel ads, video ads and images ads.

The users get to see their own personal details as soon these ads pop up on the screen.

One is follower ads and other is sponsored ads.
