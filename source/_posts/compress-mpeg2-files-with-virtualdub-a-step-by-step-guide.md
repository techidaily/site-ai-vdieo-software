 Many people have camcorders and shoot a lot of movies and want to preserve home movies for long lasting memories. If you'd like to make some home movies that can be treasured and liked by the families, try to follow the home video editing tips below.

## Home video editing tips for better home movie making

### 1\. Know your camcorder well

 Make sure that you are very familiar with your camcorder before recording so that you can shoot good videos and photos. If you are not, read the manual and practice shooting before you going to shoot the videos for your home movie.

### 2\. Make a home movie plan

 Keep in mind what your home movie is going to be adorable and pay much attention to the content. And when you record the videos, take the plan into consideration. By doing this, you can make your home movie more coherent.

### 3\. Shoot good videos

 Make sure your videos have plenty of light and are not blurry. And be conscious of the background sound, and try to control it as much as possible. Besides, try to shoot scenes from different angles.

### 4\. Add video editing effects

 When you are editing your movies using some [video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), you can trim, split, rotate, split videos before or after using the PIP, Jump-cut, Face Off effects, but do not use too many transition effects.

### 5\. Combine photos and videos together

 To make your home video more advanced, you can insert some still photos to the videos or use some advanced video effects such as [picture in picture effect in iMovie](/imovie/imovie-picture-in-picture.html). They will surely make you video more interesting.

### 6\. Don't make the home video too long

 Most home videos are long and boring. However, people usually don't like to see very trifle. So make your home video short, sweet and attractive. Get the best scenes and discard those trivial things.

### 7\. Get some humor

 Successful TV commercials are with good humor and make people happy. Adding some humor to your home videos will bring them to the next level instantly. You can find some funny video online and find some inspirations from them on how to make the video funny and attractive.

 Remember that great home videos should be short, funny, tight and easy to watch. Here are just simple home video editing tips.
