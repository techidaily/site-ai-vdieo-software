## Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?

Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.

Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.

It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Is Final Cut Express Still Available?

No, concurrent with the launch of Final Cut Pro X on June 21, 2011, Final Cut Express was discontinued and removed from the Apple online store.

You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.

Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.

As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!

## **Part 5: Best Alternative to Final Cut Express**

Now, as Final Cut Express is no longer available, you may want to try the other two editors of Apple. While iMovie mainly targeted beginners, Final Cut Express and Pro targeted users with moderate to advanced knowledge of video editing.

For those beginners who wanted to make professional-looking videos without any editing skills, Wondershare launched Filmora as an alternative to Final Cut Express and Pro.

This user-friendly made video editing as simple as ABC. From offering multiple hand-picked effects to advanced editing options, Filmora allows you to range markers, perfect your audio, group timeline clips, and perform detailed color correction with auto-correction and color wheels for free.

**Key Features**

* Advanced video editing options;
* 300+ free handcrafted effects
* User-friendly video editing tools; and
* Video conversion options to multiple formats.
