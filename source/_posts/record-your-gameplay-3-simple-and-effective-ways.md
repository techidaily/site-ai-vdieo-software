## Record Video Games with Fraps

[Fraps](http://www.fraps.com/) is the old standby that is easy to use, even for recording newbies, and remains the most popular choice for recording video gameplay.

Fraps was designed specifically to run while your games are playing and record in high quality, and it does a great job at that dedicated task.
