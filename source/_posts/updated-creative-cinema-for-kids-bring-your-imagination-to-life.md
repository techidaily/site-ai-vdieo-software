However, you may still find it hard to get a proper movie maker for your kids.

In the list, we’ve covered some easy-to-use movie makers for Windows, Mac, Chromebook, and iOS and Android devices as well. In this article, I’ll introduce how to use this handy movie maker for kids [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)to make a video.
