Saturation, exposure, and color modifications are all controlled via the Color Board. Adjust the Brightness in the color adjustment panels to brighten your movies.

**Conclusion**

Adjusting brightness has become a "small problem" for many. Oftentimes, you record a video, and it falls short of the brightness criteria – it's too dark! However, when you have quality **Video Brightness Editors**, like the ones we have reviewed above, you're in good hands. Not only are these apps easy to use with excellent functionality, but they also make editing a piece of cake for everyone.
