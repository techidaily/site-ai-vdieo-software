## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## But why would someone want to convert a video to a GIF, to begin with? There are several explanations for this

* Offers both video and photo editing tools

**Cons:**

* Collaborating with other Adobe Spark users isn’t possible with the free version of the app
* Provides only basic video editing options

### 4\. Kizoa

Creating videos for private, professional, or business purposes with Kizoa doesn’t take too much time or effort. [The platform](https://www.kizoa.com/) lets you combine audio, image, and video files which gives you almost unlimited creative freedom. In addition, you can also apply transitions and visual effects to your footage, and send it to your friends and colleagues via email or share it on social media.

![iMovie Online Alternative -Kizoa](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/kizoa-online-video-editor.jpg)

However, you won’t be able to create videos longer than one minute or export videos in resolutions larger than 720p if you opt for the free version of Kizoa. If you choose the Business version of this video editing platform, you will be able to create 4K videos, and you’ll have access to unlimited cloud storage space.

Moreover, selecting this pricing model will enable you to use RAW format images in all your projects and burn your videos to DVDs. Keep in mind that the maximum duration of the video you can create with Kizoa depends on the type of license you choose.

**Pros:**

* Supports 4K video editing
* Features hundreds of video templates
* Lets users choose the aspect ratio of their videos
* Equipped with powerful photo editing tools

**Cons:**

* You cannot create videos longer than 1 minute with the free version of Kizoa
* More expensive than its competitors

### 5\. WeVideo

Video content creators in need of an online video editing platform they can use for private, professional, and educational purposes are going to love using [WeVideo](https://www.wevideo.com/).

This web-based video editor is stacked with features that enable you to create captivating videos with ease. In addition to impressive video editing capabilities, WeVideo also enables you to capture your computer’s screen or optimize your videos for playback on different devices.

![iMovie Online Alternative WeVideo](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wevideo-online-video-editor.jpg)

However, the free version of this online video editor only allows you to export five minutes of video per month while limiting the resolution to just 480p. That’s why choosing the Unlimited, Professional, or Business subscription plans that have no publish time or cloud storage restrictions is a much better option.

Moreover, if you opt for either of these plans, you will be able to export all of your videos in 4K resolution and you’ll have access to premium video editing tools.

**Pros:**

* Rich stock footage libraries
* Allows users to export audio files
* Offers screencasting tools
* Provides social media marketing options

**Cons:**

* Limited social sharing capabilities
* Adjusting a video’s frame rate is only possible if you purchase the Business subscription plan

### Conclusion

Finding an online alternative to iMovie isn’t difficult, because there are a lot of web-based video editing platforms that enable you to perform simple video editing tasks.

Nonetheless, the free versions of online video editors often offer a limited scope of the tools you need to create videos that can attract the attention of online audiences. Still, each of the video editing platform we included in this article can be used to create different types of videos. Which of the five best free iMovie alternatives are you going to choose?
