There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

GIFs are stealing the show all across the internet. The cool repetition of frames is perfect for catching attention and wooing your audience. You can use GIFs on websites, social media, chats, and a number of channels. No wonder everybody is mad about GIFs!

Many among us now make and edit GIFs to upload on various websites. You will need to create GIF loops to control how your GIFs play online. Here are the best GIF loop maker tools for you to give expression to your creativity.

## Part 1: Best FREE GIF Infinite Loop Maker Online

If you prefer to create a looping GIF online without downloading any [gif makers on a computer](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or smartphone, you should try the following [online gif makers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).![Media.io download loop gif](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/media-io-image-to-gif-download.jpg)

### 2. EZGIF.com

EZGIF is a simple loop maker for basic needs. You can create **infinite loops** or select a finite number of repetitions. EZGIF is suitable for casual use and lets you add a few effects to your GIFs. However, you can't perform advanced functions. So, the tool is not ideal for professional use.

The good part is, you can quickly create GIF loops from your browser. The whole thing is online and totally free. Let's take you over the process of creating an infinite GIF loop in EZGIF.

1. Head over to the [EZGIF website](https://ezgif.com/maker) in your browser and click the "GIF Maker" tab on top of the page.

![EZGIF GIF Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezgif-gif-maker.jpg)

1. Click on "Choose Files" and select the image or video files on your computer. Now, click on "Upload and make a GIF."

![EZGIF GIF Maker Loop Settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezgif-animated-gif-maker-loop-settings.jpg)

1. You can now select your GIF loop parameters. Leave the "Loop count" box blank if you want an infinite loop. Or put a value according to your choice.
2. Click the "Make a GIF" button to save changes, and your looping GIF is ready.

You can also change the loop count by using the [EZGIF loop count changer](https://ezgif.com/loop-count). Just upload your GIF and provide the loop count or choose an infinite loop.

![EZGIF GIF  Loop Count Changer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ezgif-gif-loop-count-changer.jpg)

### 3. LunaPic

LunaPic is a browser-based image and GIF editor. You can use the simple GIF loop maker to edit and create infinite GIF loops. The tool also allows you to add a limited number of effects to your GIFs. Beginners can use this tool and gain experience before moving on to serious GIF makers.

### 4. GIFMaker.me

GIFMaker.me is another basic GIF loop maker and editor. You can create GIFs with infinities loops and upload them on websites and forums. The tool also lets you change sizes and create image slideshows and animations.

Here is how you can make an infinite GIF loop in GIFMaker.me.

1. Open the [GIFMaker website](https://gifmaker.me) and click on "Upload Images."
1. Look at the control panel on the right side of the page. Leave the "Repeat times" box unchanged at 0 if you want an infinite loop. Else, you can create any number of loops.

## Part 2: Best Apps for Making GIF Loops on iPhone and Android

### 1. Loop Video & GIF Maker

This is a great tool for iPhone and iOS users to create GIFs with infinite loops. You can [download the app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/loop-video-gif-maker/id1264419327) and quickly get down to creating GIFs. The app is also suitable for converting videos to GIFs.

![Loop Video & GIF Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loop-video-gif-maker.jpg)

The process of creating GIFs with infinite loops is more or less simple. You can add videos from your iPhone and choose the part for making your GIF.

You will be able to choose the speed of your GIF before saving the file. All GIFs have infinite loops by default. So, you don't need to change any settings or configurations.

The app is available for free but has a number of limitations. For example, you can only create GIFs from videos.

### 2. GIF Maker, GIF Editor, Video Maker, Video to GIF

You can make GIFs out of images, videos, and more and create infinite loops by default. The app is also useful for quickly editing your images or files before making them into GIFs.

You can record videos or click an image for GIF conversion. Existing GIFs on your phone can also be edited and turned into an infinite loop.

Along with that, you will also be able to control the play speed of your GIFs.

#### In this article

01 [Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos](#Part 1)

02 [How Vertical Videos Are Displayed](#Part 2)

03 [What's the Best Tip to Resize Social Media Vertical Video Ratio?](#Part 3)

## Part 1 Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos

**●**   **What is Square Video & Vertical Video?**

A Square Video is the one that has the same width and height while a vertical video is taller than it is wide. A vertical video or a square video is presented in the form of a landscape. A square video has an aspect ratio of 1:1 while a vertical video has an aspect ratio of 9:16.So, in a vertical video, the **horizontal video size** is less than its vertical size.

**●**   **Why Vertical Video is Dominating**

It would not be wrong to say that the world has taken a mobile route and with this, the dominance of vertical videos can be seen. As per the studies it has been found that around 75% of the video playback across the globe are from mobile phones and around 94% of the time, the phones are held vertically. These figures completely state the need for the hour-vertical videos.

With users holding their mobile phones vertically the majority of the time, the dominance of the vertical videos is no surprise.

**●**   **Benefits of Square and Vertical Videos**

There are several benefits of having square and vertical videos. These videos are specifically

designed for mobile phones and thus they can be easily posted on multiple social media sites without any need for change or editing. Other benefits of using vertical videos are their ease of recording through a mobile phone. Vertical videos are beneficial even for the advertisers and promoters as they help them reach more audiences and prospective customers through social media sites and other sites.

## Part 2 How Vertical Videos Are Displayed

Vertical videos are majorly displayed on mobile devices as smartphones are used vertically most of the time. The width of these videos is less as compared to their height and this makes them appear fit on the smartphone’s screen. Moreover, using the s**creen aspect ratio calculator**, you can further decide upon the aspect ratio depending on the size of the device screen on which video has to be played.

## Part 3 What's the Best Tip to Resize social media Vertical Video Ratio?

Listed below are the tips for resizing the social media vertical video ratio.

**●** **Learn about the Aspect Ratios**

A vertical video is taller than it is wide. Thus, any video that is taller than the 1:1 aspect ratio will be termed a vertical video. The commonly used aspect ratio is 9:16 that uses the complete vertical screen. So, to capture a vertical video, use the camera in portrait mode or edit it as per the vertical aspect ratio. There are also **TV aspect ratio calculator** tools that can be used for the task.

![Learn About Aspect Ratio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/resize-vertical-video-for-social-media-2.jpg)
