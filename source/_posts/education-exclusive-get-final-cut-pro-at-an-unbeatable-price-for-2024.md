There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.

The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a [90-day free trial of FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.

![pro-apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/pro-apps.png)

 Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99\. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There's no time limit to ownership, and it doesn't ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.

For beginners who don't actually need those many apps can always go with a **cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora**. Click and have a try!

There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.

The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a [90-day free trial of FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

Plus, this bundle is also available to students, educators, faculty members at colleges or universities, and employees of any K-12 school district. Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education includes Final Cut Pro, Logic Studio, Motion, MainStage, and Compressor.

![pro-apps](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/pro-apps.png)

 Apple has set pricing for its Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99\. The bundle includes full versions of each software. There's no time limit to ownership, and it doesn't ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.

For beginners who don't actually need those many apps can always go with a **cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora**. Click and have a try!

## Green Screen Like a Pro: FCP X Chroma Keying Essentials

# FCP X: Create a Chroma-Key (Green-screen) Effect

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

Chroma-key (also called "green screen") effects are a staple in video production. What [FCP X effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)does is allow you to make the background behind an actor transparent so you can place the actor into a different environment than a studio.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## Getting Started

First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:

* Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background "spilling" around their body or shoulders.
* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

## How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?

Chroma-key, or green screen, is an essential part of every editor to make all kinds of effects. Is there any way to make this sophisticated procedure easier way? Yes, try Filmora.

## Getting Started

First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:

* Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background "spilling" around their body or shoulders.
* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it.

MP4 is a very common media format that can keep the high image and sound quality. Many downloaded movies, streaming music videos, or recorded video clips are with .MP4 file extension. Confused about different kinds of formats? Check out [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yY1IQUuQBME)to learn what video format is and the differences between video formats.

If you have many such files, chances are that you need to edit MP4 videos.

Moreover, after you finish MP4 video editing, you can directly share your creation on YouTube, Facebook, or save to any format you want.

## How to Easily Edit MP4 Video?

Before we proceed to illustrate every detail on how to edit the MP4 video, you can download the MP4 editor first so you can follow the below steps one by one.

It's free to download now.

####

#### 1. Cut MP4 Video

To cut your MP4 video into certain parts, drag and drop the video on the Timeline and highlight it. Then place the red Time Indicator to where you want to cut the video, and click the Scissor button above the timeline.

After that, move the red marker to the end of the scene, and repeat this again to cut the video into several fragments. If you want to cut off the unwanted parts, right click the video and choose "Delete".

####

#### 2. Join MP4 Video

To join several MP4 video files into one, you just need to place all the video files on the timeline, adjust the order and hit "Create" to export it.

If you want to make the joined videos look like a really intact movie, just add transitions between clips for smooth change from one to next. To do this, click "Transition" tab on the main screen. Then drag the effect you like to the timeline to apply.

If you don't want to choose the transition one by one, let the software choose the transition randomly by right clicking and selecting "Random to All" option.

#### 3. Edit the audio of MP4 Video

Sometimes you may need to adjust the settings of audio. To do it, double click the video on the Timeline. Then a editing panel will pop up. Switch to the Audio column and you can easily change the Speed, Volume, Pitch of the audio file or add the Fade in/out effect to it.

Want to change the original audio track of your MP4 video?

No problem.

Just highlight your MP4 video, right click and choose "Audio Detach". The audio file of your video will immediately be separated and appear on the music timeline. Since it is separated from the video, you can easily delete the audio track or replace it with your own music.
