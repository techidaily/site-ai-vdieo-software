## How to Make a Time-Lapse Video in Final Cut Pro

#### Step 1 Import Clips

Choose **File** \> **New** \> **Event**. Name it and click **OK**. Label the project **Timelapse**. Then go to **File** \> **Import Media**. Browse to source clips folder. Click **Import Selected**. Drop the clips onto the timeline.

#### Step 2 Apply Time-lapse Effect

Click the **Retime** pop-up menu below the viewer and choose **Fast** (or you can access **Modify** \> **Retime** \> **Fast**). There are 4 preset options you can choose: 2x, 4x, 8x, 20x. Or you can customize the speed by selecting **Custom**.

![ Apply Timelapse effect -1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/timelapse-in-fcp-1.png)

You can set any speed by adjusting the **Rate**. Reset the speed by clicking on the little arrow on the right side of the window.

You can also drag the retiming handle to adjust the speed: dragging to the left increases the speed, and dragging to the right decreases it.

**Note:** To set speed separately for different parts of one clip, you can choose **Blade Speed** first, and then blade the clip where you want to set different speeds.

 Reaching the widest audience possible is the goal of every video content creator, but achieving this goal might be impossible if the videos you share online are not saved in the right file format. [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is probably the most common video file there is, because it is compatible with a broad range of [media players](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), as well as [online video hosting](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and social media platforms.

 WebM, on the other hand, is perfectly suited for videos that are viewed from Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, but only a handful of desktop-based media players offer support for this video file format. That is why in this article we are going to take a look at the 10 best WebM to MP4 converters on the market.

## The 10 Best WebM to MP4 Converters

[Changing the format of a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) file is never a complicated process, regardless of the software or the [web-based application](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) you are using. However, the duration, speed, and quality of the conversion process depend on the converter you’ve selected for this task. Here are the ten best WebM to MP4 converters that make the file conversion process swift and smooth.

### 1\. [UniConverter](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/videoconverter/download/)

**Price:** Subscription plans start at $2.95 for the online version of UniConverter

**Compatibility:** Windows, Mac, web-based

 This is a powerful file converter that is available both online and on desktop computers. You can choose from more than a thousand conversion formats, which enables you to convert your video files into virtually any format you want.

 So, in order to convert a WebM video to MP4 you just need to add one or more WebM files to UniConverter and then set MP4 as the output file format. The amount of time you will have to wait for the conversion process to be completed varies on the desktop and online versions of UniConverter, and you can only convert two WebM files to MP4 at the same time with the online version of this file converter.

### 2\. [VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with VLC](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-format-with-vlc.jpg)

 Even though VLC is primarily a media player, you can still use it to convert WebM videos to MP4\. Head over to the Media menu after you launch VLC and select the Convert/Save option or use the CTRL+R keyboard shortcut to bring up the Open Media window.

 Afterward, you should click on the Add button and proceed to import the WebM file into the media player, and then click on the Browse button in order to specify the location on your hard drive where the converted file is going to be saved. When done, you should click on the Convert/Save button to initiate the file conversion process.

### 3\. [Any Video Converter](https://www.any-video-converter.com/free-webm-to-mp4-converter.php)

 As its name suggests, you can convert any video file with this software regardless of the format in which it is saved. Converting WebM files to MP4 with Any Video Converter is a simple three-step process that can be completed in just a few moments.

 To import the WebM video files into Any Video Converter you must click on the Add Video button and then set MP4 as the output format.

After the conversion process is completed, your files will be accessible from the Output Folder.

### 4\. [Online Converter](https://www.onlineconverter.com/webm-to-mp4)

 After the upload is completed you just have to change the output format to MP4 and click on the Convert button. The size of the files you can convert with the free version of the platform cannot exceed 100MB and you must opt for one of the available subscription models if you want to convert video files that exceed this limit. What’s more the number of concurrent conversions you can make depends on the subscription model you select.

### 6\. [Zamzar](https://www.zamzar.com/convert/webm-to-mp4/)

 Price: Free, pricing options start at $9.00 per month

 Compatibility: Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Convertio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webm-to-mp4-with-zamzar.jpg)

Converting a video with this platform requires you to go through a simple three-step process, so you just have to upload a WebM video file, select the output format and click on the Convert Now button.

 You cannot convert files larger than 150MB with the free version of Zamzar. Moreover, this file conversion platform doesn’t allow its users to convert videos that exceed 2GB limit even if they purchase the Business subscription plan. In addition, the maximum online storage capacity you will have at your disposal varies from one subscription plan to another.

### 7\. [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/webm-to-mp4)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $9\. 52 per month

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with cloudconvert](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/cloudconvert-webm-to-mp4.jpg)

 With the support for over 200 file formats, CloudConvert is easily one of the best file conversion platforms on the Internet. That is why it is hardly a surprise that converting a WebM video file to MP4 requires a minimum amount of effort. However, the platform also enables you to fine-tune the conversion settings by choosing video and audio codecs, setting the constant frame rate or selecting the resolution of the output video.

 Trimming the WebM videos is yet another option you will have at your disposal if you choose to convert your files with CloudConvert. In case you’re planning on using this file conversion platform on a regular basis, you can choose how many conversion minutes you’re going to have every month.

### 8\. [Video2Edit](https://www.video2edit.com/convert/webm-to-mp4)

**Price:** Free, $15.00 per month

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Video2Edit](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/webm-to-mp4-with-video2edit.jpg)

 Video2Edit offers a quick way to convert a WebM video to MP4, since you just have to upload a file, either from Google Drive, Dropbox or your hard drive and click on the Start button. Optionally, you can adjust the frame rate, choose a video codec or select a new resolution for the video you’re converting. What’s more, the Video2Edit platform lets you disable a video’s audio track or change the audio codec.

 Creating a profile on this file conversion platform will enable you to convert WebM video files that are smaller than 400MB. Purchasing the premium version of Video2Edit will enable you to convert WebM files that don’t exceed a 1GB size limit.

### 9\. [Onlineconvertforfree](https://onlineconvertfree.com/convert-format/webm-to-mp4/)

**Price:** Free, pricing options start at $6.99

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Onlineconvertforfree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/onlineconvertfree-webm-to-mp4.jpg)

 You don’t need any previous experience with the file conversion process to convert a WebM video to MP4 with the online file conversion platform. Simply upload a file from your computer or from an online source, choose MP4 as the output file format and then download your file after the conversion.

 The platform offers batch conversion options, which can be quite useful if you are looking to convert multiple video files quickly. It is worth noting that converting a video larger than 500MB with this platform isn’t possible, regardless of the subscription model you choose. The number of daily conversions, however, is not limited.

### 10\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/webm-to-mp4/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Aconvert](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-webm-to-mp4.jpg)

 This is a simple online file conversion tool that lets you convert WebM videos that are stored locally on your computer or on the cloud. You just have to select the source from which you want to import the video, select the output format and decide if you want to change the [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or size.

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files.

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Onlineconvertforfree](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/onlineconvertfree-webm-to-mp4.jpg)

 You don’t need any previous experience with the file conversion process to convert a WebM video to MP4 with the online file conversion platform. Simply upload a file from your computer or from an online source, choose MP4 as the output file format and then download your file after the conversion.

 The platform offers batch conversion options, which can be quite useful if you are looking to convert multiple video files quickly. It is worth noting that converting a video larger than 500MB with this platform isn’t possible, regardless of the subscription model you choose. The number of daily conversions, however, is not limited.

### 10\. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/webm-to-mp4/)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Web-based

![Convert WebM video to MP4 with Aconvert](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/aconvert-webm-to-mp4.jpg)

 This is a simple online file conversion tool that lets you convert WebM videos that are stored locally on your computer or on the cloud. You just have to select the source from which you want to import the video, select the output format and decide if you want to change the [video’s frame rate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), [aspect ratio](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or size.

 When done, simply click on the Convert Now button and then after the conversion process is completed, proceed to download your video to your computer. The only downside is that you cannot convert WebM video files that are larger than 200MB with Aconvert.

## WebM vs MP4: Which Video File Format is Better?

 The file format in which a video is saved determines its compatibility with different media players. So, if your videos are only going to be played in web-browsers like Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox, then it is better to save your video in WebM file format.

 However, you should keep in mind that this file format isn’t used often outside of the online context and that finding a media player that is compatible with the WebM format can be a challenge. MP4 video files, on the other hand, can be played in virtually any macOS or Windows-based media player or uploaded to YouTube or any other video hosting service. That’s why MP4 is a more appealing option to video content creators who want to ensure that their videos can be played anywhere regardless of the device or the media player that is being used to open them.

**Conclusion**

 Changing a video’s file format in 2020 no longer requires you to have access to a professional video editing software, because there are countless online file conversion platforms, that enable you to complete this process in just a couple of clicks. Even so, most online solutions limit the maximum size of the video files you can convert with them, which is why it is better to choose one of the desktop-based options if you are working with large video files. Which WebM to MP4 converter do you like to use the most? Share your opinions with us in the comments.
