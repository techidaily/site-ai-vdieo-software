# Troubleshooting Tips for Final Cut Pro X

Most of the time, Final Cut Pro X works great. But, when it doesn't, here are some things you can try to get your system back to normal in no time.

Here's the quick list:

* [Quit and restart Final Cut Pro](#part1)
* [Check your media](#part2)
* [Delete render files and re-render](#part3)
* [Create a new library](#part4)
* [Create a new user account](#part5)
* [Trash FCP X Preferences](#part6)
* [Remove and re-install Final Cut Pro](#part7)

#### 1 Quit and restart Final Cut Pro

Restarting Final Cut releases and refreshes memory so that if something was confusing your system, restarting Final Cut can fix it.

#### 2 Check your media

![check your media](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/image-size.png "check your media")

Frequently, problems are caused by still images that are too big. Limit your digital photos to no more than 5,000 pixels on a side. Final Cut is a video editor, not a still image editor. Images that are too large cause problems.

Also, stock footage files are known to cause problems. Be sure to convert all stock footage to ProRes 422 before importing into Final Cut Pro X.

#### 3 Delete render files and re-render

Open your Project in the Timeline and choose File > Delete Project Render Files. Render files can become corrupt. Trashing them forces Final Cut to create new render files which often will fix the problem.

#### 4 Create a new library

Create a new library and a new project. Then, copy and paste sections of the old project into the new project. Test each section until you find the spot that doesn't work. At which point, you can remove or replace the bad media.

#### 5 Create a new user account

![Create a new user account](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/new-ccount.png "Create a new user account")

Open System Preferences > Accounts and create a new User Account. This resets all preferences for both Final Cut and the operating system back to factory defaults. The only problem with doing this is that a new user account can't access files stored in the Home directory of the old user account. For this reason, I always recommend storing all libraries on external hard drives, not the Home Directory.

#### 6 Trash FCP X Preferences

Trash Final Cut Pro X preference files. There are at least three preference files and, if you've had a crash, there can be more. Here are the steps:

* Go to the Finder.
* Hold down on the Option key and click on the Go menu. The Library folder inside your Home Directory now shows up as a selection inside this menu. (You could also type Shift+Command+G, or select Go > Go To Folder in the Finder; then, type \~/Library/ and click Go.)
* Open to the Library > Preferences folder.
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.LSSharedFileList.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.plist
* Trash com.apple.FinalCut.UserDestinations.plist
* Trash any other files that start with "com.apple.finalcut".
* Empty the Trash.
* Restart Final Cut Pro X.

#### 7 Remove and reinstall Final Cut Pro

If all else fails, delete FCPX from the Applications folder and re-install it from the [Mac App Store](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12).

One of these techniques should fix your problem. If not, it's time to contact [Apple Support](http://www.apple.com/support/).

**\# Recommendation:**

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

After all, nobody is protected from rookie developers as they can come with strange codes, causing plugin crashing problems. It is not the user’s mistake if the code is incorrect. Therefore, you should simply consider taking advice from the help center of the plugin site or ask any of their experts to settle the matter.

In addition to this, the plugins are constantly updating by the developers therefore users willing to install the latest plugins should first see whether the plugin is compatible with their Final Cut Pro X version or not.

## How to Fix Plugins Not Working in Final Cut Pro X?

Imagine using Final Cut Pro latest version and downloading some new transitions for your video, but they display crashed or malfunctioned or do not appear the way you want them to be.

![color-finale-2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/top-10-free-fcpx-plugins-color-finale-2.jpg)

Fortunately, there are easy ways to fix the problem when they are not properly working inside the Final Cut Pro X. Generally, the issue can be fixed by simply updating and re-installing the plugin in your system but if that does not work, consider the below checklist of the elements you should consider fixing the problems related to the generators, effects, transitions, and titles inside the Final Cut Pro X.

* **Searching on the Correct Part** \- When looking for the plugin, you should always ensure looking for it in the correct part of the Final Cut Pro X. For instance, if you are looking for the effects, make sure that you are checking them in the effects panel.
* **Proper Installation** \- The next tip that you must consider is the correct and proper installation of the plugin. You should follow the steps of the plugin installation in order to avoid incorrect installation in your Final Cut Pro X.
* **Localization of the Folders** \- Now comes the localization of the folders meaning their placement. You should ensure keeping your motion effects, templates, generators, transitions, and titles folders localized.

* **Delete the Plugin from Everywhere** \- You should always consider deleting the plugin from everywhere in your system if it continues to trouble you. Delete it from the finder and trash folders, then re-download, re-install and restart your system.
* **Seek Help from the Plugin Creator** \- If none of the aforementioned tips helps, you should definitely turn to the service provider or the plugin creator who can offer you their expert assistance.
