When all of these effects are combined, music makers become a must-have for everyone. Continue reading this article to learn about the best **Video Editor with Music** that makes it easier to incorporate music into your videos!

## Part 1: Best Video Editors with Music on Windows and Mac

Whether it's a personal video, a promo, or a cinematic trailer, the audio or song in a video may have a significant impact on our impression of it.

But what if you just have muted footage or a cracked and damaged audio file that has to be repaired, and you would like to add audio to the movie right now? In such a case, you may make things easy for yourself by using the applications listed below!

### 1  Windows 10 Photos App

**Supported System**: Windows 10 and Windows 11

**Pricing:** Free

Microsoft or Windows Photo App, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements, as well as capabilities for managing and editing video, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, add background music and 3D effects to films, and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for working with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

The Windows 10 Photos application's artificial intelligence function allows you to create a video with music automatically with the [**Automatic Video feature**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's simple to accomplish, what’s more, there are some music track presets in the Photos app, so you can change the background music and edit it further manually.

Besides that, you can also create a new video project from scratch and choose music from its background music library.

**Step 1:** Launch the Photos app, go to **New video** and then click **New Video Project** button at the top of the screen, and then rename the video accordingly.

![windows 10 photos new video project](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-new-video-project.jpg)

**Step 2:** Click on the **+Add** option to import photos or videos to the project from your PC or collection, and then drop and place them to the storyboard.

![place video image to windows 10 photos storyboard](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/place-video-image-to-windows-10-photos-storyboard.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next, from the top-right, press the **Background music** menu, pick one from the list. And the music track will fit to the length of the video automatically. You can enable [**Sync your video to the music’s beat**](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to sync music to the beat of a video.

![add background music to windows 10 photo video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-background-music-to-windows-10-photo-video.jpg)

**Step 4:** Then press the **Done** button. This is how you can use the Windows Photos App and add a soundtrack from its background music library to videos. Windows 10 has several benefits, and with the correct tools, you can get the most out of it.

### 2  Apple iMovie

**Supported System**: macOS, iOS

**Pricing:** Free

Apple's entry-level desktop video editing software can transform your video and photographs into professional-looking creations. However, [Apple's video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) hasn't evolved much in the last several years.

Nevertheless, it still outperforms what you will get with Windows 10, which would be limited to the (albeit increasing) video capabilities integrated within Windows' Photos app.

In your digital films, Apple iMovie contains superb capabilities for media management, color grading, speed, green-screen effects, narration, and music.

It isn't always the first to support new formats—[360-degree video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is currently unavailable, but it supports 4K. [Trailers](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and Movies are two of the greatest storyboard-based movie-making features for beginners in iMovie.

For beginner-level video editing, Apple iMovie is an excellent choice. For background sound, the iMovie creator integrates with iTunes and GarageBand, and you may choose from a good range of background soundtracks and audio effects, such as four pitch levels, cosmic, and robot.

The Reduce Background Noise option, on the other hand, is controlled by a slider. Follow these steps to add music to your videos using iMovie:

**Step 1:** Click the **Add Media** button while your application is visible in the timeline.
