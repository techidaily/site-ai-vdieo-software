### Choosing the Right Movie Maker for Novice Video Editors

Finding a movie maker, you really like using can be a bit more complicated than it seems since there are so many different options available. The camera you have, your computer or the genre of videos you want to create should all play an important role during the process of selecting your first movie maker.

In case you’re just looking for a simple video editor that lets you process footage quickly you should opt for iMovie or Clipchamp, but if you would like to have access to more advanced video editing options then Filmora may be one of the best options on the market.

## FAQs

### Q1.What is the easiest movie maker?

There is a wide range of video makers for PC. But not all of them are easy to use. So if you are looking for some user-friendly video editors, try using iMovie (for Mac) and Windows Movie Maker (for Windows users). Both of them offer basic tools for video editing.

On the other hand, if you want to work like a pro on a simple and convenient interface, download Filmora. It is an ideal tool for Mac and Windows with lots of great features to make your videos entertaining and meaningful.

### Q2. How can I make a video with music and pictures for free?

Some mobile and PC movie makers, like Filmora, Filmora, iMovie, CapCut and more, have a simple and user-friendly timeline. All you need to do is import your main clip on the timeline. Then, import your favorite music and image files you wish to add to your video. Now, place the audio and images below the main video clip and play the video to see the results. If you’re happy with the outcome, save or export the file to your mobile or PC.
