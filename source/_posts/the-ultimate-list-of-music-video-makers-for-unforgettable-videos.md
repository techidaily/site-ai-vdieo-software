Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

Optionally, you can also add Noise to the photo you’re cartooning if it fits the style you’re trying to achieve. However, picking the right picture can turn out to be vital for the success of the cartoon process in Paint.net.

### 3\. [iToon](https://www.itoon.net/)

**Price:** 14-day free trial, $29.95

**Compatibility:** Windows, iOS

iToon makes turning photos into cartoons look easy because everyone can cartoon their photos with this photo to cartoon software. Once you’ve installed iToon on your PC, you just have to launch it and import the photo you want to cartoon and then choose the effect you want to apply.

There are more than 50 cartoon effects to choose from and you just have to click on the one you like to apply it. Each effect can be edited so that it fits your image better, and if you don’t like how the effect matches your photo you can always hit the undo button and try another one. Click on the Apply icon to confirm the changes you’ve made and proceed to save the cartoon you created to your hard drive.
