## Method 2: Speed Up to Make a Time lapse Video

In case that you want to make a time lapse video with video footage, below are the step-by-step tutorial:

#### 1 Import Video Footage

Just like importing photos to Filmora, follow the steps to import the video clips to media library.

#### 2 Cut out part of the video for time lapse editing (optional)

Next, drag your video onto the video column in the timeline. Select the loaded video and click the "Play" button. While playing the video, drag the slider bar at the start time and hit the "Split" icon to cut out the part you want to do time lapse editing.

#### 3 Speed up to create time lapse video

Right click on the video clip in the timeline to select **Speed and Duration**. Then a window will pop up for you to adjust the settings of video. Find the **Speed** option and drag the slider bar to the right to increase the speed. If you set the playback speed to play at 200% the original speed, then the 30-second clip be only 15 seconds (twice the speed). After that click **OK**. Click the **Play** button to preview the result. Filmora now support up to 100x fast mo and 0.01x slow mo.
