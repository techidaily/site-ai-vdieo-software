## Part 2 A Step-by-Step Guide to Convert Video to MP3

There is a wide variety of prominent **video to audio converter** tools available in the digital market. The basic concept behind these tools is to extract the audio content from your favorite video and save it as an MP3 file.

The RIP of the audio is pretty different from the inbuilt program within the application. Many experienced professionals opt for an MP3 file format because of its high-frequency audio quality, smaller file size, etc.

After you convert **the video to MP3**, you will listen to the audio or the background music offline, and the MP3 file format guarantees flawless audio quality.

We want to introduce you to [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which offers many professional and basic video effects and editing tools and converts **video to** **MP3**.
