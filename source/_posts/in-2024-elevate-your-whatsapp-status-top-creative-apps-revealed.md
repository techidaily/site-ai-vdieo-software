## Watermark-Free Video Editing: The Top 7 Merging Solutions

Sometimes, when delving into the vast space of internet and trying to find the perfect online platforms or software in order to edit some videos, it might get frustrating to find only the ones with watermark. But of course, the resources are endless and in case we have some information, we can easily access the free video editing platforms which give us the opportunity to edit our videos without undesired logos on them. In this case, we will be discussing 6 video mergers without watermark, and the way we can use them – the tools and features they offer, and how we can get the best out of them.

* **Photos by Microsoft**

If you are too lazy to get high-quality results using popular video editors, like Filmora, try Photos App. It is a built-in program that usually opens your images on Windows 10, but you can also use it for merging your videos. And guess what? Since it comes within the system, all the features, although limited, are absolutely free.

### How to Merge Videos on Windows using Photos App?

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2023/03/merging-videos-photos-app.png)

* **Fastreel by Movavi**

[Fastreel](https://www.fastreel.com/) is a free online video editor. It is extremely easy to use right away, without installing anything. So, on Fastreel, one can edit videos or use online templates in the browser itself. Actually, the first tool we see in the list of Fastreel tools is to merge a video; then, it can be used in order to compress, make, cut, and create a video. On fastreel, you can add a watermark to a video, if wanted - so, it is very voluntary. As for the merging of a video, when this tool is chosen, it’s pretty simple to understand the steps – you can just drop/add multiple files right away.

![video-mergers-without-watermark.html](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/video-mergers-without-watermark-1.jpg)

The format must be either of the listed: MP4, MOV, MKV, AVI, and WMV, and the total size mustn’t exceed 500 MB. Then, in order to add some transitions, a style can be chosen from the drop-down menu, and after that, you should hit on Continue button to stitch the videos together. For the last step, you can export the result by selecting Download option.

## Part 2: Best VFX Video Effects Editor Apps for Android

If you are an Android lover and prefer using non-Apple devices, you have plenty of options when it comes to selecting the best **movie effects app** that could enable you to apply special effects to the videos your smart device has or captures using its camera.

In case you are looking for an efficient **video special effects app for Android**, those listed below are worth your attention:

### 1\. Movie Booth FX Free

While using [Movie Booth FX Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=bizomobile.actionmovie.free&hl=en%5FUS), all you need to do is, record a footage from your camera, and add special effects to it. The three main categories that this **video special effects app** ships along with include Action, Sci-Fi, and Horror. Depending on the type of footage you captured, and the kind of output you want to have, you can pick any of these categories, and apply your favorite effect that is available within it.

Although the program is free to install, various other options and features can be unlocked by paying for them with in-app purchases.

### 2\. MovieRide FX

[This video special effects app for Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.waterston.movieridefx&hl=en%5FUS) has several templates that allow you to apply various VFX to the footages you record using your Android device. With the effects like Space Wars, Space Walk, Thunder Bolt, Storms, etc., you can virtually live in the movies, and act like a character. Although some of the effects that MovieRide FX has are paid, you definitely won’t regret buying them considering the precision and ease at which you can decorate your clips.
