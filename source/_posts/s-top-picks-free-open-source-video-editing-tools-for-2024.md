## 1\. OpenShot

[OpenShot](https://www.openshot.org/download/) is a free and **open-source video editor** with no premium features. In contrast, the website provides a donation option.

**Pros**

* Easy-to-use interface
* Unlimited layers

**Cons**

* It sometimes lags, which is inconvenient

## 2\. Shotcut

However, because Shotcut was created for Linux, many users may find the UI a little strange. Regardless, it's still a fantastic editor.

Shotcut also has a lot of sound editing capabilities, so it's great for audiophiles. Customers may change bass and treble, construct bandpass filters, alter gain, apply dynamic compression, and more with its array of audio fine-tuning options.

* Offers smooth service

**Cons**
