## What Can You Do with Splice?

The Splice app is at your service to explore its features and make compelling videos. Check out some of the creative things you can do with Splice.

#### 1) Add Music

Besides adding effects, borders, sound effects, and transitions to your video, you can spice it up with some background music. You can either pick a track from a streaming service or create some voiceovers. The Splice app also provides a wide array of music from its library.

Step 1\. To access music, tap on the "Audio" tab in the editor.

Step 2\. Then select one of the "+" symbols to add a category. Alternatively, import music from your "iTunes" library if you operate an iOS device.

Step 3\. Choose which part of the video to add your music for background listening.

Step 1\. First, tap a video on the project screen.
Step 2\. The "Plus" and "Pencil" buttons will appear shortly. Then tap on the pencil to unleash several options.

Step 2\. Delete the blank background to make the text a subtitle. If you don’t then Splice will treat all texts as titles.  
Step 3\. Lastly, double-tap the media screen and type the title of your video.

#### 4) Add video or image overlays

You can increase your creativity level by adding image overlays.

Step 1\. Ensure the video or image you wish to add to the overlay is in the timeline.  
Step 2\. Then press and hold on to the video or image you wish to add as an overlay.  
Step 3\. Drag the video or image to the "Drop here to turn it into an overlay" tab.  
Step 4: Finally, trim your clip and make other necessary adjustments.

#### 5) Apply advanced effects

It doesn’t have to be plain. Your video needs some elevating additions to it to make it stand out. With Splice, you can trim, cut, and even merge your videos. Likewise, you can add titles, adjust the speed, and even point out specific moments such as slowing down your clips. It also lets you add effects for more appealing looks.

Step 1\. Click on the "Edit video" icon.  
Step 2\. Pick a tool depending on the effect you want to achieve, like a blur, mixing multiple audio tracks, etc.  
Step 3\. Click on the "Apply" tab to apply the effects to your clip.

#### 6) Share your video on social media platforms

This feature is quite useful when it comes to showing your friends and potential customers what you are capable of composing. Here is how to share your videos on social media sites once you complete the editing process. Remember to save your project first.

Step 1: From your phone, locate the video you want to share.  
Step 2\. Then click on the "Share" button found at the top-right corner of the screen.  
Step 3\. Choose the site to upload your video. You’ll then be able to upload it directly to Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter, among many other platforms.

## Does Splice have a desktop version?

The Filmora video editor is one of its kind with adequate effects and plugins. With an intuitive user interface, Filmora lets you quickly edit any video to a professional level. Use its massive resource packs to turn your video into an explicit outcome.
