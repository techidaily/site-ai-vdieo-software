There are two broad categories of effects in Final Cut Pro X: Inspector effects and Effects Browser effects.

I've written previously about how to use Inspector effects to create a [picture-in-picture](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) effect, among many other effects available to us in Final Cut Pro. In this article, I want to show you how to apply an effect to a clip, modify that effect, temporarily turn that effect on or off, or delete it entirely.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## How to Apply Effects to Video in Final Cut Pro X

* [Find and apply an effect](#part1)
* [Modify an effect](#part2)
* [Disable and delete an effect](#part3)
* [Extra credit](#part4)

#### Find and apply an effect

Here is our clip - a fearsome polar bear.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx001.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To apply an effect, first select the clip in the Timeline.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx002.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Then, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Effects Browser (or type Cmd + 5).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx003.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The Browser, like all the effects browsers, lists categories of effects on the left, a search box at the bottom to use for searching for the names of effects, and effects for each category on the right.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx004.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Here, for example, I've selected the Blur category, with my cursor near the Gaussian blur effect. (Gaussian blur is the best effect to use when you want a clip to look blurry.)

To apply an effect, do one of two things:

* Drag the effect from the Browser onto the clip you want to change.
* If the clip, or clips, are selected, double-click the effect in the Browser to apply it.

#### Modify an effect

To modify an effect, click this icon in the Toolbar to open the Inspector (or type Cmd + 4).

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx005.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Click the Video tab in the Inspector. Effects from the Effects Browser are always listed at the top of the Inspector.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx006.jpg "add effects in fcp")

Grab a slider and drag it to see what happens. For example, to make an image blurrier, drag the Amount slider to the right. To lessen the effect, drag it to the left.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx007.jpg "add effects in fcp")

#### Disable and delete an effect

To temporarily disable an effect, without deleting it, click the blue box so that it turns gray.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx008.jpg "add effects in fcp")

To enable an effect, click the gray box so it turns blue again.

To delete an effect, click the name of the effect - in this example: Gaussian - and press the big Delete key.

![add effects in fcp](https://images.wondershare.com/images/multimedia/video-editor/efx009.jpg "add effects in fcp")

The effect will be deleted from the selected clip.

#### Extra credit

You can apply, modify, even delete the same effect to multiple clips by first selecting all the clips you want to change in the Timeline then adding, changing the settings, or deleting an effect in the Inspector.

#### Summary

The process of applying effects is the same for all effects you apply from the Effects Browser. In future articles I'll show you how to use this technique to create a wide variety of different effects in Final Cut Pro X.

## Part 2: Top 3  Studio for Mac Alternatives

### 1\. Final Cut Pro

Final Cut Pro is a professional video editing software from Apple for anybody looking for a more powerful video editor for their Macs than the included iMovie. The software is also an excellent alternative for professionals creating content for TV and cinema. The latest version runs natively on M1 chip; you can expect apparent video editing improvements.

New features include transcoding media files automatically when copying or consolidating projects and downloadable user guides. Other highlighted recent features include Smart Conform, stabilization for 360-degree videos, performance improvements with RED and Canon RAW files, Inspector panel improvements, and audio crossfades.

![Final Cut Pro](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pinnacle-studio-for-mac-2.jpg)

**Price:** $299 (onetime payment, no subscription)

**Pros:**

* Fast and superb performance
* Works perfectly with Apple computers
* 360-degree video and HDR Support
* Multicam support

**Cons:**

* Lacks motion tracking and stabilization for 360-degree videos
* Integration with Adobe software seems problematic

### 2\. Lightworks

Another free video editing software that works as a good replacement for pinnacle studio for Mac is Lightworks. It's packed with many useful features, and although there is paid version, the free version has all the bells and whistles needed for beginners.

However, if you're working with 4K videos for YouTube or Vimeo—you need to get the paid version of Lightworks as this feature isn't available in the free version. The paid version costs $25 a month. The free version includes multi-cam support, high-precision video trimming, video exports at 720p, and support for most video formats.

![Lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pinnacle-studio-for-mac-3.jpg)

**Price:** $25/month

**Pros:**

* Has many video tutorials
* Intuitive interface and easy to use
* The free version is ideal for beginners

**Cons:**

* No 4K video support in the free version
* Lacks predefined filters and effects

### 3\. OpenShot

With easy-to-use features, a simple interface, and real-time previews for transitions between clips, unlimited layers, and audio mixing capabilities, OpenShot is one of the top free video editing software around. One of the best things about OpenShot is that its interface allows for easy-to-use drag and drop features. If you're a Mac user and looking for a free, open-source video editor that packs more features than iMovie—OpenShot is a great alternative you can't miss.

With OpenShot's special effects engine, users can modify, reverse, slow up or slow down videos, and preview projects in real-time. Furthermore, other standard features of OpenShot include composition, image overlays, clip resizing, trimming, snapping, scaling, watermarks, video transitions, title templates, creating personalized SVG vector titles, desktop integration, adjusting fonts, colors, 3D animated titles, and more.

![Lightworks](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pinnacle-studio-for-mac-4.jpg)

**Price:** Free, Open Source

**Pros:**

* Ideal for beginners
* Unlimited layers
* Professional transitions and effects
* Runs on entry-levels hardware

**Cons**

* Exporting videos isn't the fastest
