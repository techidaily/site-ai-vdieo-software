There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.

The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a [90-day free trial of FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.

For beginners who don't actually need those many apps can always go with a **cheaper yet maybe better editor, Filmora**. Click and have a try!

There are many choices of software for video editing, but there is one that has been dominating the market for years – this is Final Cut Pro. Final Cut Pro, which was created by Apple, and took on a completely different path from other professional software.

The unique thing about Final Cut Pro is that it allows you to create video files easily and even edit them on the Mac using Final Cut Pro software alone, without any outside help. Before buying Final cut pro, you may want to have a [90-day free trial of FCPX.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

The Mac App Store has made editing software more affordable. When Apple first acquired the Final Cut, it sold for $2,500, but now you can get a full version of the program from their store for only a cent shy of $300—an incredible deal.

## **Part 1: What is in Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education?**

The Pro Apps Bundle includes five industry-leading professional software from Apple. These powerful creative tools are best for musicians, video editors, and anyone looking to create the best content.

There's no time limit to ownership, and it doesn't ask for a subscription or membership fee, unlike other subscription-based tools and software like Adobe Premiere Pro or Adobe Photoshop.

Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99 is totally worth getting if you plan to use Final Cut Pro and want Logic Studio and Mainstage 3 for free. If you're thinking about purchasing Final Cut Pro or Logic Studio separately, be prepared to pay $299.99 and $199.99, respectively. MainStage is more affordable at $29.99\. Motion and Compressor aren't sold separately as they come bundled with Final Cut Pro.

**So, exactly how much are you saving here?**

If you need Final Cut Pro for work, we suggest you buy Pro Apps Bundle for Education, as you'll be saving $100\. You'll also get Logic Pro and Mainstage for free. In total, you'll be saving **$330**—an unbeatable deal if you ask me. I don't anyone offers that kind of deal.

If you're a musician or composer and have no use for Final Cut Pro, you can buy Logic Studio for $199.99—that's your decision. But, you need to purchase Mainstage for $29.99, in case you need it. Nonetheless, we still recommend you get the Apple's Pro Apps Bundle for Education at $199.99.
