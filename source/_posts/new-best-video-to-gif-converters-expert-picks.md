## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

GIFs are basically soundless picture collections that have been modified to resemble a video. On the other hand, videos are gathered as a kind of rich media that includes both motion and sound. What's more, the viewing experiences for these two file kinds are somewhat different.

## What’s the Difference Between a Video and a GIF?

GIFs are very popular among digital marketers (and anybody who uses the internet). These little bursts of repeating material may breathe new life into otherwise dull blog posts, emails, web pages, infographics, and other documents. Isn't it thrilling?

While GIFs and videos may seem identical, the two forms of media are highly distinct, and the differences begin when the file types are first gathered.

### 1. Filmora Green Screen

The Green Screen effect by Filmora is an advanced feature of the Overlays option.

The Green Screen effect can be used to place subjects over a number of different backgrounds. You can make a green screen on Filmora by simply clicking on the chroma key. It also offers spill removal, color correction, filters, and transition effects to use on your green screen.

### 2. Filmora Split Screen

The Split Screen feature in Wondershare Filmora allows you to display multiple clips on the screen at the same time. This feature comes in handy when you want to compare different angled shots or add two or more clips to your video. The effect helps users to add a specific style and class into your video.

Filmora currently offers around 30 split screen templates. You can add up to 6 different video clips in these presets at the same time. The default duration of the split screen is 5 seconds, but you can adjust it according to your requirements. You can add all kinds of borders, do a color correction, tuning and apply motion effects on your split-screen.

### 3. Filmora Beat Detection

**[Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)** offers a Beat Detection option for users, which marks audio beats from the inserted sound clip in your video automatically. The tool makes it easy to match your edits with the music, allowing a smooth clip. Analyzing and detecting the beats is entirely automatic. Using Filmora, syncing your video to the music is now relatively easy and quick. Even the customization of beat markers doesn't take long. It is an excellent tool for filming, even for people who are first-timers. You can change the highlight beat frequency, offset or add transitions in your beats. This will allow your videos to appear more in-sync and vivid.

#### Conclusion
