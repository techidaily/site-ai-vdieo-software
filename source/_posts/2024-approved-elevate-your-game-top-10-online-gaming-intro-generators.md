## Easy Video Editing Software for Beginners

New to video editing and don't know how and where to edit videos, don't have a media production, or can't find a qualified video editor to film and produce your highlights? It's all fine! The purpose of today's article is to demonstrate that, with the correct video editor, you also can create slick, sophisticated video content—regardless of perception—and maintain your content marketing strategy ahead of the game.

In the coming year, [over half of marketers](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/blog-content-videos) will add YouTube and Facebook platforms for streaming video; one-third of all internet usage is spent viewing video; video will make for more than 80% of all internet traffic by 2019\. 80% of the time! Let's get started! From the most affordable (i.e., free!) for the beginners. Here is the best **basic video editor** that includes the features you'll find handy in a video editor.

#### In this article

01 [ Best Basic Video Editors for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\] ](#part1)

02 [Best Free Basic Video Editors Online](#part2)

## Part 1: Best Basic Video Editors for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\]

What should you do when you do not have access to a video studio or a team of video experts on staff to film and edit your videos? Do not be concerned!

Without the need for an in-house team or outsourcing your video brand awareness, it's quicker than ever to make high-quality films on your own. Here are some of the top picks.

### 1\. Windows Photos App

Microsoft Photos, a free digital viewer and video editor included with Windows 10 and Windows 11, provides capable visual effects and video enhancements, as well as techniques for organizing and editing videos, everything in a touch-friendly functionality. Windows 10/11 comes with the Photos app pre-integrated. You don't have to do anything to obtain the app when you have Windows 10/11.

The free Microsoft photo and video editing app is a great choice for viewing, editing, and sharing digital photos and videos. As the name suggests, it's for Windows users – a delight to use a picture and video-editing tool that's simple to use, clean, and has all the functions you need for basic viewing and repairs. Obviously, a full-featured program like the Windows Photos App is required for advanced photo organizing, optimization, and effects.

![windows photos app interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-photos-app-interface.jpg)

Clips may be trimmed or divided, [text can be added](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), motion or 3D effects can be applied, filters can be used, and the [speed can be changed](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). It's a huge array that allows you to create an interesting result. There are over 20 options for [adding soundtracks](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) at the backend at the top.

The Photos app features the Automatic Video tool which can [create video automatically with the images or videos uploaded](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

### 2\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

Okay, so this one won't actually apply to those of you who deal with computers, but we'd be negligent if we left it off the roster. Thanks to its high-class interface, it doesn't get much nicer than Apple iMovie regarding elegance and beauty. It is only supported by macOS and iOS.

The ten [high-fidelity filters in iMovie](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are among the best in the video editing game, and you can utilize AirDrop to instantly and smoothly transmit your video to your Mac when you're filming on your iPhone or working on your iPad.

![imovie editing interface](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-editing-interface.jpg)

[Green-screen](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), or "chroma-key," is among iMovie's most prized tools since it enables you to relocate your characters to exotic locations—say, Hawaii—at any time. Do you want to add "Somewhere Over the Rainbow" to the image? Because iMovie is integrated with iTunes and GarageBand, you may quickly add unique music and sounds to your movie. Once your video is finished, send it out into the world via iMessage, Facebook, YouTube, or any of iMovie's numerous easily accessible venues.

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

## Part 2: What should be included in a video resume?

In essence, there is no difference between a video resume and a paper resume, which are means of obtaining an interview. So, in the video resume, the following information should be included as well:

**Education background:** When recording video resumes, briefly introduce the educational experience and qualifications, the majors and graduates, and the specific skills and abilities if necessary.

**Work experience:** Focus on past jobs and positions and achievements.

**Training experience:** What kind of skills training did you participate in, and what benefits do you get from it?

**Job intention:** which position you’re applying for, and why do you want to this job. You can state it from your majors and your future career plans.

**Concluding remarks:**  you can end your resume recording with sentences like Thank you for watching my resume and looking forward to the opportunity to get an interview.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.
