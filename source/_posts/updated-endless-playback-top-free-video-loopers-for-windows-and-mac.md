## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

## Part 1: Best Video Loopers to Loop Videos for Free on Windows and Mac

Whatever you are motivated to create a video loop, you should know that it's a straightforward process. If you wish to create a looping video, you'll need to download a video editing tool. Here we will cover the best free video looper for you and how you can create a loop video.

### 1\. [Window Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/get-windows-media-player-81718e0d-cfce-25b1-aee3-94596b658287)

Windows Media Player offers a clean and intuitive interface, outstanding performance, particularly with big media libraries, and solid integration with Urge, the company's de facto music streaming service. Whenever Windows Media Player approaches the finish of a video, it gives you the option to repeat it manually, but it does not do it routinely.

Enabling the Repeat function, on the other hand, directs Media Player to play the video in a constant loop until you actively stop it or shut the software. Looping a video impacts the rest of the video from start to finish; Media Player does not only allow you to loop a portion of it but more.

**How to Loop Video in Windows Media Player?**

**Step 1:** Drag your mouse pointer over the Media Player window in **Now Playing** status to reveal the _playback settings_.

**Step 2:** To continually repeat the movie, click the **Turn Repeat On** button, denoted by a circular arrow, and glows blue when toggled on.

(**Note:** If you don't see this button in a tiny playing window, select the square **Maximize** symbol or drag the video corners to expand the window bigger).

**Step 3:** Until you exit the application or click the **Turn Repeat Off** icon, the Repeat option will repeat the whole video.

![play video in loop windows media player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/play-video-in-loop-windows-media-player.jpg)

 **Note:** When you close the window, your prior feature selection is retained; thus, the next video you watch will play in a loop until you turn off the **Repeat** feature.

### 2\. [QuickTime Player](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)

QuickTime Player is a basic application that allows you to watch videos and record screencasts on your Mac. You may also produce your videos and audio recordings and do rapid changes. Basic activities such as video flipping and clip splitting are included in edits.

You can record a screencast of a lecture, or capture a portion of the screen with QuickTime, which is ideal for creating a video lesson for an application. Using QuickTime, you may cut the length of video clips or merge many pieces into a single film. Drag the clips to a film window - QuickTime dynamically scales or trims them to fit the size of the movie.

It can also play your video on loop. Here's how:

**How to Loop Video with QuickTime Player?**

If you're using a Mac and wish to generate a video loop in QuickTime Player, follow these steps:

**Step 1:** Launch the **QuickTime** player to watch any video.

**Step 2**: In the taskbar at the top right of the screen, select **View**.

**Step 3:** From the drop-down option, select **Loop**. And that's it. You have put a video on loop.

![loop video quicktime player](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/loop-video-quicktime-player.jpg)

These two video programs simplify setting up videos to run on repeat; they don't allow you to loop individual video parts. To do so, you'll need more powerful software, such as the well-known VLC Media Player.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/)

The VLC media player is a program that allows you to play video and music files on your computer. The VLC player can operate on several operating systems, including Windows 2021, XP, and Mac OS X, because of the device's powerful CPUs.

This makes the VLC Media Player an excellent alternative for anybody searching for a media player that can simultaneously run many programs. This free video editing program also includes special capabilities that allow it to execute numerous jobs simultaneously, including video editing, data transmission, graphic display, sound editing, and much more.

 **How to Loop a part of the Video in VLC Media Player Continuously?**

Create a beginning point A and an ending point B, which are in the center of VLC's timeline. There is a control button for the A to B looping function in the Advanced Controls. The starting and ending positions inside a media file can be specified by bringing up the advanced controls first. Now follow these steps to put a video on loop in the VLC media player:

**Step 1:** Open the video with VLC media player. Go to **View**. Select the **Advanced Controls** option.

![vlc media player advanced controls option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-advanced-controls-option.jpg)

**Step 2**: Go to the bottom of the VLC media player, and you will find 4 controls above the play button. Click the third button **Loop from Piont A to Point B continuously** to mark the starting point of the loop; and then click the third button again to mark the end of the loop.

![vlc media player loop part of video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vlc-media-player-loop-part-of-video.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click the Play button and you will find the video is playing loop. Until you press the Loop from point A to point B option for the third time to discontinue the looped playback, the segment of the clip you've put up will keep on playing on loop.

### 4\. [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/imovie/)

iMovie is a fantastic tool for making beautiful short films, music videos, picture slideshows, and other creative projects. You may also loop videos straight in the iMovie software; however, you'll need to utilize QuickTime to loop movies continually if you want to export them. Here are the quick and easy ways to loop a movie into iMovie.

**How to Loop Video in iMovie?**

**Step 1: Open** iMovie and then the video clip you want to loop in.

**Step 2**: Select the **Loop Playback** option from the **View** menu. Once the video begins to play, it will loop indefinitely until you stop it.

### 5\. [Windows Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4)

Microsoft Photos, a free photo viewer and editor bundled with Windows 10, provides capable image editing and photo improvements and capabilities for organizing and editing movies, all in a touch-friendly interface.

You may doodle on photographs, [apply background music](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [3D effects to videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), and use automated object tagging to make searching easier. Microsoft Photos is a wonderful tool for dealing with digital photographs, and for certain users, it may even replace third-party photo applications.

**How to Loop Video in Windows 10 Photos app?**

Windows 10 comes with the Photos app preinstalled. It can also assist you in making your movie loop. Here's how to do it.

**Step 1:** Import your video to the Photos app, and use the trim tool to get the part you want to loop.

![trim video windows 10 photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/trim-video-windows-10-photos.jpg)

**Step 2:** Copy and paste the trimmed video to the storyboard as many times as you like. And then click the Finish Video button to export the video.

![windows 10 photos finish video export](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-10-photos-finish-video-export.jpg)

## Part 2: Create Boomerang Loop with [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Looping a movie is not a difficult chore for anyone, even a novice. As we all know, most video players cease playing when a video approaches its climax. You can manually reverse the portion if you wish to see it with Boomerang effects.

You may loop and enjoy the video you like continuously when you do a new project in [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), a video editor for all video content creators.

While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn **how to change video shape**.

Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.

With that said, here you will learn **how to change the shape of a video** using one of the most advanced and versatile post-production tools, Wondershare Filmora.

Want to learn more about aspect ratio of your video? [Click here!](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Or, you just want to [transfer your video into vertical.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 1: How to Change Video Shape from Rectangle to Square

Depending on the recording device and the target audiences a video is intended to be distributed to, the aspect ratio of the produced footage could be 16:9, 4:3, or 21:9 that makes the film rectangular-shaped. Given that, the aspect ratio can be modified to change the film shape from rectangle to square.

The instructions given below explain **how to change video shape** from rectangle to square in Wondershare Filmora:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Wondershare Filmora on your PC (a Windows 10 computer is used here), click the **Add Files** icon from the center of the **Media** window present at the upper-left section, and use the **Open** box that appears to select and import the source video to Filmora. Next, drag the video from the **Media** window to the Timeline, and select your preferred option when/if the **Project Setting** confirmation box appears.

**Step 2: Change Aspect Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon from the upper-left area of the Timeline itself. On the **Crop and Zoom** window that opens next, select **1:1** from the **Ratio** drop-down list, and click **OK** to save the new setting.

**Step 3: Export the Video**

Click **EXPORT** from the top-center area of the interface, go to the **Local** tab on the **Export** box, select your preferred format from the **Format** list in the left pane, optionally click **SETTINGS** from the right window to make other adjustments if necessary, and click **EXPORT** from the bottom-right corner of the box.

For more details, please refer to this article: [How to Resize a Video to Right Aspect Ratio and Size.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 2: Change Video Shape by Cropping

If your preferred aspect ratio isn’t available in the ‘Ratio’ drop-down list of the ‘Crop and Zoom’ window, Wondershare Filmora allows you to manually change the video to a custom shape.

![crop-video-9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-video-9.jpg)

You can learn **how to change the shape of a video** to an unlisted aspect ratio by following the instructions given below:

**Step 1: Import the Video and Get to the Crop and Zoom Window**

Follow the method explained in **Step 1** of **Part 1** to import a video to Wondershare Filmora, and then add it to the Timeline.

**Step 2: Select Custom Ratio**

Select the video in the Timeline, and click the **Crop and Zoom** icon as explained earlier to open its window. Next, select **Custom** from the **Ratio** drop-down list to be able to crop the videos unproportionally.

**Step 3: Crop the Video Manually**

Drag the cropping handles from any one edge of the video. Repeat this process for all the four sides to select the area of interest. Click **OK** to save the changes.

**Step 4: Export the Video**

Follow the process explained in **Step 3** of **Part 1** to export the modified video.

## Part 3: Change Video Shape to Circle or Other Shapes in Filmora

Another, rather better way of changing videos to custom shapes is with the help of image or shape masking.

In Filmora you can apply image masks either from the existing presets, i.e. circle, star, diamond, etc., or you can add custom photos if need be. Professionals generally use custom pictures to create fancy logos and titles.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

On the other hand, shape masking allows you to mask a background video with a foreground footage in a custom shape.

Although the basic concept of both types of masking is same, the options available under each can be used to produce effective outputs.

That said, following are the instructions to apply both types of masking to your videos:

#### Image Masking

The steps given below explain **how to change video shape** with image masking in Filmora:

Notice how the **_fx_** icon appears on the video layer showing that the effect has been successfully added.

**Step 3: Customize Image Mask**

On the Timeline, double-click the video layer you applied **Image Mask** to, and notice all the available shapes available under the **Preset Mask** section on the **Video Effects** \> **Image Mask** window that appears at the upper-left area. You can double-click any of the available shape presets to apply it to the video layer. In addition, drag the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size, and edge smoothness respectively. You can also check the **Invert Mask** box to reverse the masking effect on the video. Finally, click **OK** to save the changes, and follow the method explained in earlier parts to export the video.

#### Shape Masking

The following steps explain **how to change the shape of a video** with shape masks in Filmora:

**Step 1: Get to the Utility Window**

Add at two footages on their individual layers in the Timeline (make sure to place the second layer above the first one), and follow the method explained above to get to the **Effects** \> **Utility** window.

**Step 2: Add Shape Mask**

Drag **Shape Mask** from the **Utility** window, and drop it on top of the video itself in the Timeline. Confirm that the **_fx_** icon appears on the video layer to ensure that the effect has been applied.

**Step 3: Customize Shape Mask**

Double-click the video layer in the Timeline you applied shape mask to. On the **Video Effects** \> **Shape Mask** window, use the **X** and **Y**, and **Width**, **Height**, and **Feather** sliders to adjust the mask’s position, size and edge smoothness respectively. Optionally check the **Invert Mask** box to reverse the masking effect, and click **OK** to save the settings. Next, follow the method explained earlier to export the video.

While most videos nowadays are rectangular, and are recorded in either landscape or portrait orientation, there are some social media platforms that require the clips to be square shaped. If you want to upload your footages on such websites, it is essential to learn **how to change video shape**.

Another benefit of changing the shape of the recorded films is that they can be adjusted in limited amount of space, especially if they are to be posted on a website. Furthermore, some fancy designs such as star-shaped or circle-shaped videos attract more attention when used in digital marketing campaigns.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Note: in the free trial version of Filmora 11, there will be a watermark like most online video editors listed below. But you’re allowed to use all the features and effects and save it to your computer or share it on YouTube or Vimeo directly. If you’re a teacher or a student or school staff, you can enjoy our [discount](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on purchasing.

## Top 10+ Best Free Online Video Editors

Though some online video editing tools listed below provide free trial versions, if you need to download the video, you may need to upgrade your free plan to the paid version.

Please note the online video editors listed are in no particular order.

Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation.

You can select **different aspect ratios** such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides **a built-in guide** so you can make a video with it easily.

Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the **video footage can’t be exported in 4K**. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.

The editing features are **simple and limited** but it also allows you to record a webcam. One amazing thing is that there is no watermark and the video quality is good after cutting clips with Video Toolbox.

You need to **sign up** and activate your account in your email first and then log in to enter the main menu. And to be honest, I found this video editor layout is **outdated and not user-friendly** enough. You need to click the select action to choose the target editing feature and in more cases, there will be **no real-time preview window** to check the editing progress.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes. All classic video editing functions such as trim, crop, zoom, cut, split as well as stunning video effects (PIP, Green Screen, Faceo-off, etc) are provided. Up to 100 audio and video tracks to use.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

#### 1\. Is There Any Online Video Editor No Watermark?

Yes, there are some free online video editors without watermarks, such as ClipChamp, Online Video Cutter and Hippo Video after exporting. But you should note that in some online video editing tool, the video resolution may be limited to 480p in the free plan.

While, free online video editors like Clip Champ didn't watermark your video but the quality is limited to 480P. Video Toolbox can remain the original quality and keeps no watermark, but the interface isn't intuitive. The rising star Kapwing will be a good choice if you don't need many editing features.

#### 2\. Is There Any Online Video Maker With Music And Pictures?

For those who want to use the music and pictures from the online video maker, I recommend you try Magisto and Kizoa. From the description of these two editors, you can see they are a perfect match.

 **Conclusion**

Above are some free online video makers that you can use right in your browser on both Windows, Mac, Linux or mobile devices if you like. Most of these online video makers are beginners friendly and easy to use since they provide simple editing features. But some of them may need you to register first to use the online video editing tools, and some may leave a braning watermark in the free version.

However, Filmora is one of the easiest-to-use home video editing software with special editing features lets you seamlessly stitch together video clips, music & text, apply effects and get a professional-looking home movie in minutes.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

With the creation of social video sharing networks online like YouTube, Vimeo, Instagram and Vine, editing and making videos stopped being the exclusive domain of professionals. All you need right now is a good computer system and bingo you are a video editor. You can now edit videos online without downloading any program on your Windows or Mac computer - all you require is a decent network connection to the internet. In this article, we are going to talk about the top 10 most recommended best free online video editing solutions that you can access online.

Most of these free online video editors are beginner-friendly, so even if you just come to the video editing world, you can make a video quickly with these online video editing tools. If you’re an experienced [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), then check our picks of the best professional video editing software.

Personally, I don’t recommend using online tools since sometimes the network connection isn’t good, and when there is a network error, all the efforts are gone. Editing videos with online tools also need high upload and download speed, so it’s suitable for editing short and small size video clips. Besides, online video editing solutions maybe not the best choice if you need more advanced editing options and beautiful video effects. In this case, I highly recommend Wondershare Filmora for the tool you can't miss. Just download it to have a try to explore the editing features, plentiful effects and presets. It can be used on Mac and Windows computers both and is suitable for beginners and semi-pros both.

### #2\. ClipChamp

![online video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Simple drag and drop features allow you to trim, crop, rotate, and flip videos as per their need. Further, it is also possible to adjust brightness, saturation, and contrast with ease. You can also add transitions, text, overlays, backgrounds. There is a stock library that provides both paid and free video and audio files, so you can choose based on your situation.

You can select **different aspect ratios** such as 1:1, 9:16, 4:3, or 16：9, and it also provides **a built-in guide** so you can make a video with it easily. However, you **need to sign up with your Google account or Facebook account** first before using this **all-in-one online video editor**. And the free version is **limited to export at the 480P SD** resolution with **no watermark**. Though you can import 4K footage, it is recommended to compress it first since large files may cause problems when editing, and the **video footage can’t be exported in 4K**. I’m not sure what the problem is, but when I added the audio to the video and play it back, it didn’t go smooth. Let me know if you’ve met the same issue when using it in the comment below.

Wideo is an online video creating site for **creating animated videos, explainer videos** and other marketing videos with a lot of video templates. **Sign in first** to make a video online with this animated editor and then drag and drop elements of the website's editing service, create a sequence of animations.

Wideo allows you to use the different elements as many times as you want to create your video and unlike some websites, you are not limited to using stock elements (text, cartoons, drawings, and images) and components. It seems that Wideo only allows you to **upload your own images** in .jpg, .png and .gif and backgrounds or music, I didn’t find out a way to add my own video footage to this online video editor. Let me know if you have any clue.

What I like about Wideo is that it allows you to choose **video aspect ratio** such as 16:9, 1:1, and 9;16, and there are **a lot of video templates** available, although most of them need to pay. It also provides a 7 -day trial, and the paid versions cost from 19/mo to 79/mo.
