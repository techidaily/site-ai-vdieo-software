#### **Difference between Rewind and Reverse:**

#### **Reverse:**

The word reverse as the name reflects, means that we can play a video from its end towards the initial position. Yes, it is possible to reverse the order of video frames in order to arrange them in such a way that last frame appears first following the reverse sequence so that first frame goes to the last position in the clip.

#### **Rewind:**

On the other side rewind is also an interesting feature for video editing where users simply duplicate the clip in form of a segment or make adjustments over range selection and then rewind that particular segment at a speed many times faster than the original speed of clip. After this they play segment of original clip in normal speed towards forward direction.

Although it is possible to get the rewind effect in videos with simple reverse option but still Apple platform supports both of these as standalone options.

## How to reverse a clip in Final Cut Pro

You might have heard about Retiming effect in videos where we either speed up our clip or slow it down by certain time factor so that a desired effect can be achieved. There are two types of retiming effects: Variable speed type and constant speed format. FCP is capable enough to merge the reverse option with retiming effects so that something innovative can be developed even with simple editing efforts.

#### **Step 1:**

First of all go to timeline and then select the desired clip from your collection that you want to reverse. It is also possible to apply this effect on a group of clips as per need.

#### **Step 2:**

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take –** Don’t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more –** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Don’t improvise, make a script –** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what you’re good at –** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, don’t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Don’t forget your audience –** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they don’t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.
