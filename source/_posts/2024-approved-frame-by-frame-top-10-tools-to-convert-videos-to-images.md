## Part 1: Converting Videos to JPEG and PNG Images with Desktop Video Converters for macOS and Windows

Exporting a single frame of a video clip is an easy task even amateur photo and video editors can perform effortlessly. Mac and PC users have a broad range of options at their disposal if they want to make still images from their videos. Let’s have a look at some of the best video converters you can use to capture still frames and create JPEG or PNG files.

### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Filmora is a video editing software that also offers the option to capture frames of all video clips you use in your projects after you launch the Filmora video editor, import a video file that contains the frames you would like to save as still images.

To extract still images with the original high quality, you can import and place these videos to Project Media and then double-click it to preview. In the preview window, click the Camera icon located in the lower right corner to take a snapshot. It is worth noting that you can only create PNG files with this video editing software, and you may need to change the photo format if PNG isn’t your choice.

![Extract PNG Image from Filmora9 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/take-snapchat-9.jpg)

Alternatively, you can use the CTRL+ALT+S keyboard shortcut to take a snapshot of the frame in a video clip. The image you created will be added to the Media tab automatically, and you can proceed to right-click on it and select the Reveal in Explorer option to gain access to the original file.

To extract still image from the video frame by frame, you can add the media asset to the timeline and use the playhead to find the frame you would like to extract from the video. When done, leave the playhead at the location on the timeline where the frame is located, and then click on the Snapshot icon.

### 2\. [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

This is arguably the best photo editing software ever created that grants you access to all the tools you need to manipulate pictures as you see fit. Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.

![Convert Video to Image in Photoshop ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-to-image-with-adobe-photoshop.jpg)

The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.

![Render Video to convert to Images in PS ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-video-to-images-photoshop.jpg)

When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

Extracting still frames with VLC media players is a technical process that will require some understanding of the video editing process. Even so, you can still use this open-source software to generate PNG or JPEG files from your videos.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-convert-video-to-image-preference.jpg)

Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.

Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-video-filter-video-to-image.jpg)

Next time you play a video in VLC the media player will automatically capture still frames at the recording ratio you specified.

### 4\. [Free Video to JPEG Converter](https://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-Video-to-JPG-Converter.htm)

If you are looking for a quick and free way to create still images from videos, this Windows-based tool is one of the least complicated options PC users have at their disposal. After you open Free Video to JPEG Converter you just have to click on the Add Files button and import a video from which you would like to extract still frames.

![Free Video to JPEG Converter ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/free-video-to-jpeg-converter.jpg)

You can then specify the frequency at which frames are going to be extracted and see the total number of frames that are going to be created from your video. Afterward, you just have to specify the location at which the still frames are going to be saved and click on the Convert button.

### 5\. [Virtual Dub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

Before you can start extracting still frames from videos with Virtual Dub, you must first install the FFMpeg plugin pack because this video converter cannot open common video file formats like MP4 or MOV. Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.

![ Convert Video to Image Virtual Dub](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/virtual-dub-video-to-image-control.jpg)

Insert the frequency at which still frames are going to be captured into the box next to the Decimate by setting and click on the OK button. Head over to the File menu and select the Image Sequence option from the Export submenu. Before you start extracting still frames from a video you just have to select the file format of the output files, and then wait for Virtual Dub to complete the process.

### 1\. [Online-Convert](https://image.online-convert.com/convert-to-jpg)

### 2\. [Adobe Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html)

This is arguably the best photo editing software ever created that grants you access to all the tools you need to manipulate pictures as you see fit. Adobe Photoshop also enables its users to edit videos, although in a limited capacity. In order to turn a video into a series of separate frames, you just have to import a video file into Adobe Photoshop by clicking on the file menu and selecting the Import option.

![Convert Video to Image in Photoshop ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/convert-video-to-image-with-adobe-photoshop.jpg)

The video clip is going to be displayed on the timeline that is located at the bottom of the screen and you just have to specify the segment of that file you would like to break down into frames. You can do this by dragging the handles located above the video clip that allows you to set the start and end of the work area.

![Render Video to convert to Images in PS ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/save-video-to-images-photoshop.jpg)

When done, head over to the File menu, and select the Render Video option from the Export submenu. After the Render Video window pops up on the screen, you have to change the Adobe Media Encoder option to Photoshop Image Sequence and then click on the Render button. You should keep in mind that the photo editor is going to create separate image files for all the frames that were within the work area you defined, which is why it is important to reduce the work area to the minimum in order to avoid generating hundreds of JPEG images.

### 3\. [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html)

Extracting still frames with VLC media players is a technical process that will require some understanding of the video editing process. Even so, you can still use this open-source software to generate PNG or JPEG files from your videos.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-convert-video-to-image-preference.jpg)

Select the Preferences option from the Tools menu and then click on the Video tab. Make sure that the All option is selected under Show Settings and scroll down until you find the Filters option and expand this menu. Locate the Scene Filter, click on it and then proceed to specify the format in which your images are going to be saved and adjust the Recording Ratio.

Click on the Save button to confirm the changes, then go back to the Filter submenu, and this time you should click on it rather than expand it. Locate the Scene Video filter, make sure that the checkbox next to it is selected, and click OK to complete the process.

![Convert video to image Preferences  in VCL ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/vcl-video-filter-video-to-image.jpg)

Next time you play a video in VLC the media player will automatically capture still frames at the recording ratio you specified.

### 4\. [Free Video to JPEG Converter](https://www.dvdvideosoft.com/products/dvd/Free-Video-to-JPG-Converter.htm)

You can then specify the frequency at which frames are going to be extracted and see the total number of frames that are going to be created from your video. Afterward, you just have to specify the location at which the still frames are going to be saved and click on the Convert button.

### 5\. [Virtual Dub](http://www.virtualdub.org/)

Before you can start extracting still frames from videos with Virtual Dub, you must first install the FFMpeg plugin pack because this video converter cannot open common video file formats like MP4 or MOV. Installing this plugin can get a little technical, but it is far from being complicated. Afterward, you just have to launch Virtual Dub and import the video you would like to use to create JPEG files by clicking on the File menu and selecting the Open option.

# Top 10+ Slow Motion Video Editing Software

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Slow motion effects can add a "close-up in time", and introduce a feeling of surreality. If you want to slow down a video to show more details or transfer a kind of atmosphere to a video, you will need video editing software to do it. Here is a list of some of the best video editors to make a video slow down in the market.

## Top 10+ Slow Motion Video Editing Software

#### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Pricing:** Free trial

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Not just for slowing down or speeding up videos, the Filmora can also be used for a wide array of functions, such like slippting, cropping or reversing videos, and other advanced features like green screen, PIP, and face-off. The recent revamping of the user interface supports the easier use of more tools.

Filmora offers two ways to make a slow-motion effect in a video. The quickest way of applying the slow-motion effect to video is by selecting the target clip in the timeline, clicking the Speed icon in the toolbar, and choosing the target slow speed presets from **0.5X, 0.25X, 0.1X, 0.05X** and **0.01X.** The smaller the preset is, the slower the video will be.

![ Filmora  change speed ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-motion-presets.jpg)

Of course, you can also right-click the video in the timeline, select the **Speed and Duration** option from the menu and then change the speed by dragging the speed slider or the duration period in the **Custom Speed** window.

![ Filmora9 custom speed window](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/custom-speed-window.jpg)

Check the video below to see how to control the video speed and make a fast forward, slow motion or freeze frame video.

#### 3\. [Twixtor](http://www.revisionfx.com/products/twixtor/)

**Pricing:** Ranges from $82.49 for the upgrades to $595.00 for the full version

Continuously raising the bar for slow motion editing software, Twixtor is probably the most popular and highly praised video editing application that focuses on slow and fast motions in the market. Despite the commendations the software keeps getting, its pricing may be a little too expensive. The full version of Twixtor Pro falls at $595.00.

![timewarp](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/timewarp.jpg)

#### 4\. [Slomovideo](http://slowmovideo.granjow.net/)

**Pricing:** Free

Although its bare and unappealing graphical user interface might turn off some people, Slomovideo does what it was created to do, which is to slow motion in videos down, quite well. To add to that, Slomovideo is an open source program, which means that it is free. A downside, however, is that it seems slower than other software and applications. However, if you are opposed to shelling out hundreds of dollars in order to produce a crisp and smooth slow motion video with expensive software, then this freeware is for you.

![slowmovideo](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/slowmovideo.jpg)

#### 5\. [MotionPerfect](http://www.softpedia.com/get/Multimedia/Video/Video-Editors/MotionPerfect.shtml)

**Pricing:** $49.95

This cross-platform utility allows the speed and frame rate to be set and the duration of the files to be changed. Motion compensated interpolation and morphing algorithms are used instead of repeating or blending contiguous frames.

![motionperfect](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/motionperfect.jpg)

#### 6\. [Apple Motion](https://www.apple.com/final-cut-pro/motion/)

**Pricing:** Bundled with Apple Final Cut Studio

The feature Optical Flow within Apple Motion was once obscure but now many users attest to its quality. Being bundled with the Apple Final Cut Studio already, previous FCS users can use Apple Motion for free.

![apple-motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/apple-motion.jpg)

#### 7\. [Boris Continuum Time Unit](https://borisfx.com/products/continuum/)

**Pricing:** $199.00

Using the retiming effects of Optical Flow along with the automatic keyframe generation of the Beat Reactor, Boris Continuum Time Unit can produce high-quality slow and fast motion videos.

![boris-continuum-time-unit](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/boris-continuum-time-unit.jpg)

#### 8\. [ReSpeedr](https://www.prodad.com/Home-29756,l-us.html)

**Pricing:** $99

Similar to Slomovideo, Respeedr is also an open source video editing tool. It is a stand-alone application that makes use of a frame-based motion-flow analysis, which means that it uses dynamic frame-blending.It offers an array of time lapse and slow motion tools that are needed to make the transition smooth but the quality of the video crisp. Moreover, its graphical user interface is very easy to understand.

![respeedr](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/respeedr.jpg)

Slow motion effects can add a "close-up in time", and introduce a feeling of surreality. If you want to slow down a video to show more details or transfer a kind of atmosphere to a video, you will need video editing software to do it. Here is a list of some of the best video editors to make a video slow down in the market.

## Top 10+ Slow Motion Video Editing Software

#### 1\. [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Pricing:** Free trial

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Not just for slowing down or speeding up videos, the Filmora can also be used for a wide array of functions, such like slippting, cropping or reversing videos, and other advanced features like green screen, PIP, and face-off. The recent revamping of the user interface supports the easier use of more tools.

Filmora offers two ways to make a slow-motion effect in a video. The quickest way of applying the slow-motion effect to video is by selecting the target clip in the timeline, clicking the Speed icon in the toolbar, and choosing the target slow speed presets from **0.5X, 0.25X, 0.1X, 0.05X** and **0.01X.** The smaller the preset is, the slower the video will be.

![ Filmora  change speed ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slow-motion-presets.jpg)

Of course, you can also right-click the video in the timeline, select the **Speed and Duration** option from the menu and then change the speed by dragging the speed slider or the duration period in the **Custom Speed** window.

#### 3\. [Twixtor](http://www.revisionfx.com/products/twixtor/)

**Pricing:** Ranges from $82.49 for the upgrades to $595.00 for the full version
