Developed by Lightricks Studio, Videoleap is one of the most powerful video editors, which is available for iOS and Android devices. While you can directly install Videoleap on your iPhone or Android phone by visiting its App/Play Store page, you won’t find its desktop application. That’s why a lot of people find it hard to install Videoleap on their macOS systems. Don’t worry – here, I will let you know how to install **Videoleap for MacBook** and would also list its best alternatives.

* [**Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook**](#part3)

## Part 1: Major Features of Videoleap

You might already know that Videoleap is a popular smartphone app that is used for video editing on iOS and Android devices. It is a part of the Lightricks Creative Suite that would let you create, edit, and share your videos in one place.

* You can find all kinds of basic editing options in Videoleap to crop, trim, rotate, or flip your videos.
* Videoleap provides a layer-based editing interface that would let you work on videos, images, audio tracks, and other media content.
* There are hundreds of visual effects (like transitions, stickers, filters, etc.) that you can readily use in Videoleap.
* Some of the other smart features of Videoleap would be green screen edits, prism effects, sound editing, and so on.

## Part 2: Download and Install Videoleap for MacBook

As I have listed above, **Videoleap for MacBook** is not directly available as it runs on iOS and Android devices only. Though, you can access this video editor on your Mac by using any reliable Android emulator tool. An emulator can load an Android OS environment on your Windows or Mac system, letting you run all these smartphone apps.

While there are plenty of Android emulators out there, these are some of the most popular options:

* BlueStacks
* Nox Player
* MEmu Player
* ARChon Player

Out of them, let’s consider the example of BlueStacks as it is the most popular and reliable Android emulator in the market. You can install BlueStacks on your MacBook for free, log in to your Google account, and can readily use Videoleap on it.

**Step 1: Install a Reliable Android Emulator like BlueStacks**

To begin with, you can install any reliable Android emulator on your MacBook. For instance, if you want to install BlueStacks, then you can visit its official website, and click on the “Download” button.

Now, you can just click on the installer to run it on your MacBook. You can just go through a simple click-through process and select a location where you want to install the application on your Mac.

Just make sure that you have at least 5GB of available storage of your Mac (and it should have at least 2GB RAM).

**Step 2: Connect your Google Account on BlueStacks**

Once you have installed BlueStacks on your MacBook, you can launch it, and go to the Google Play app. From here, you can just log in to an active Google account on the BlueStacks app.

## Part 3: 2 Best Alternatives to Videoleap for MacBook

As you can see, installing **Videoleap for a MacBook** can be a tedious job as it is only available for smartphones. Therefore, instead of using an emulator to install Videoleap, you can consider using the following video editors on your Mac.
