 Expect for the Action Cam Tool, Wondershare Filmora's Full mode offers you a range of features from inserting a text message to adding stunning still and motion graphics. With Filmora, producing a dreamy video is realistic. It has a great ability to expand your imagination with the assistance of hundred unique visual effects.

 Apart from the video editing features, Filmora facilitates you to edit the audio sources too. You will be able to trim and split the audio clips separately. Adjusting volume with fade in and fade out features and voice overs will benefit you in creating an exceptional audio clip to match the video you created.

 You can load the videos you captured to your pc and then directly import them to the work area or the Filmora and start editing. If not, you can directly record videos into the Filmora and do your editing by; Clicking the Record button on the upper left corner of the Media library panel and then, in the pop up Capture Video window, clicking the record to start recording and clicking it again to stop recording. After the recoding is done, click OK to save the recorded video file in the default Captured file folder.

 Fully featured edition of the Filmora is available from $29.99 per year. However, you can download the demo version and try. The demo version contains Filmora Logo on all the output videos.

 **Pros**

 **Cons**

* Watermark appears on Demo mode videos

#### 2. [Final Cut Pro X](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/final-cut-pro/id424389933?mt=12)

 This is another powerful tool which is compatible ONLY with Apple. There are various effects available to use. Filters, transitions, videos enhancements tools, color adjustments and interesting text designs are available with Final Cut Pro X. This is a good software tool for a professional video editor. Need some time to get familiar with the interface as the interface is little bit complex because of the features.

 **Pros**

* Large number of tools with interesting effects
* Can produce professional video edits
* Lots of templates are available

#### 3.[Vegas Pro](http://www.vegascreativesoftware.com/us/vegas-pro/)

 **Pros**

* Innovative features
* Lots of filters
* Support any format

 **Cons**

* Very high price ($599.95)
* Needs High End PC perfomances
