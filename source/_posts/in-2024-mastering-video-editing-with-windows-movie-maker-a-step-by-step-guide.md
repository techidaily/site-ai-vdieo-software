## Part 3 Top 5 Tips For Creating Effective Thumbnails

To make your thumbnails interesting and effective we have shortlisted a few useful tips as below.

**●** Keep it clutter-free: It's always good to keep your thumbnail simple and clean without any clutter. If you use too many elements in a thumbnail, they will look messy when watched on a mobile device.

**●** Using a still image from the video: Though you can set a customized thumbnail for your videos, an automatic image is also selected by YouTube. It might be a possibility that the image automatically selected is good enough and effective and thus creating a customized thumbnail is not required.

**●** Using editing software like [Wondershare Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for creating customized graphics: A good editing software can be used for creating an effective and impressive image. Wondershare Filmora is one such professional tool that can be considered. This Windows and Mac-based program can let you edit your images using multiple features. Simple and fast to use, the software also supports batch processing so that multiple files as thumbnails for multiple videos can be created at a time.

**●** Use eye-catchy titles: Using catchy titles in your thumbnails is an effective way to grab the attention of the viewers. A title will give a glimpse to the viewers of the content of the video.

**●** Try different designs: If you are not sure about a thumbnail design, create multiple ones and then add them to the video one by one. Select the design that goes best and looks attractive.
