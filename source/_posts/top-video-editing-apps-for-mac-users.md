#### 3. [Video to MP3 â€“ Convert Audio](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/video-to-mp3-convert-audio/id1400653079)

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

![MP4 to MP3 Converter  for ios](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mp3-converter-audio-extractor.jpg)

Converting a video saved on your phoneâ€™s camera roll to MP3 with the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor requires you to just select a file and start the conversion process. You wonâ€™t even have to specify the output format, because MP3 is the appâ€™s default output format. After the conversion, you can listen to the file you created to make sure that its quality is at a satisfying level. However, you wonâ€™t have any control over the bitrate of the output file or any other settings that can increase the quality of the MP3 youâ€™re generating. Moreover, the app offers only modest file-sharing options, and you have to make an in-app purchase if you want to gain access to all features the MP3 Converter â€“ Audio Extractor has to offer.
