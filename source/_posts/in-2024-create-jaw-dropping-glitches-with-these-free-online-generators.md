The Glitch Art movement is gaining a lot of attention on social media, as the photos and videos that contain glitches gather thousands of views and likes. Some video editing software products don’t have preset glitch effects, and creating this effect from scratch can be a time-consuming task.

Online glitch effect generators enable you to add glitch effects to both photos and videos even if you have no previous video editing experience, which makes them a great option for all social media content creators who want to go through the editing process as quickly as possible. That’s why in this article we are going to take you through some of the best free online glitch effect generators you can use to edit photos and videos.

GFTO is an online text generator that offers hundreds of text templates, including the Glitch Text template.

Furthermore, you can choose the text’s color and size or select one of the available fonts.

![Glitch text effect generator](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/engfto-generator_glitch_logo_font_text_effect.jpg)

The platform also lets you upload your own fonts, apply gradients, and change the text style. Optionally, you can add an outline to the text, pick the color of the text edges, or change the background. Once you are done editing the text you can save it to your computer as a PNG file and use it as an opening title for your video.

**Pros**

### 4. [Glitchatron](http://www.errozero.co.uk/glitchatron/)

Adding a glitch to a photo with Glitchatron is a straightforward task that can be completed in just a few moments. Once you’ve uploaded the photo to which you want to apply a glitch effect, you should choose from Low, Medium, High, Extreme, and Destroyed glitch level options.

![Glitchatron ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/errozero-glitch-effect-generator.jpg)

Glitchatron also lets you apply a circular or triangular mask to the photo or add a text overlay. You can insert the text, adjust its size, pick an alignment option, or decide if you want the text to be black or white. However, other color options are unavailable, and you can’t change the font.

**Pros**

* No photo editing skills required
* Users can adjust the intensity of the glitch effect
* Text overlays are available
* Good social sharing capabilities

**Cons**

* Text can be either black or white
* No photo editing tools

### 5. [ImageGlitcher](https://www.airtightinteractive.com/demos/js/imageglitcher/)

You shouldn’t expect great results from this online glitch generator, as the website is poorly designed and it offers only a few basic glitch adjustment options. The size of the photo you upload to the website has an impact on how it is going to be displayed, which means that photos in large resolutions may be difficult to preview.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg" border="0">PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![ImageGlitcher ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/airtightinteractive-image-glitcher.jpg)

Furthermore, you can only adjust Glitchiness and Brightness options, while you can also toggle the Scan Line option on and off. You can’t do much else with ImageGlitcher, not even share your creations on social media. Applying the glitch effect to a photo may take a while, and the website might crash in the process. That’s why you shouldn’t use ImageGlitcher unless it is your only option to glitch a photo.

**Pros**

* It is free
* Support images saved in JPEG format

**Cons**

* Website crashes easily
* Only basic glitch effect settings
* Poorly designed and difficult to navigate
* Only works with photos that have resolution lower than 1024x1024

### 6. [Image Glitch Tool](https://snorpey.github.io/jpg-glitch/)

Image Glitch Tool is a simple glitch effect generator that allows you to upload a photo and adjust the effect’s settings quickly. The photo you upload to this platform is going to be displayed in the Preview Window, and the platform will also resize the photo automatically in case it exceeds its size limitations to avoid errors.

![Image Glitch Tool ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/jpg-glitch.jpg)

What’s more, Image Glitch Tool enables you to take photos with a webcam and apply glitch effect to them just moments after you captured them. The Amount, Seed, Iterations, and Quality sliders allow you to fine-tune the glitch effect so that it fits the image you are editing.

![HTML5 Image Glitcher ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/html5-image-glitcher.jpg)
