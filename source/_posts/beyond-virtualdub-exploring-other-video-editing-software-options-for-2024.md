The new **Smart Fit Audio Duration tool** allows you to change the length of background music in your movie while keeping the style and tempo of the music. When you're down in the woods of fine-tuning video and audio features, the application's user interface is about as plain and easy as a tool with such a massive amount of options can be, but it can still be intimidating.

**Step 1:** To import audio clips, go to **Import Media Files** and choose to import audio clips straight from your portable hard drive.

**Step 2:** Right-click on the song and select **Add to Music Track** or drag the music onto the playlist.

**Step 3:** You may choose from a large range of unique background music recordings. Click on the **Media category** in the Media Room to open a drop-down menu, where you'll discover the **Background Music** selection.

### 5  Movavi Video Editor

**Supported System**: Window, macOS

**Pricing:** Free trial

Movavi is a video editing program with a straightforward, user-friendly interface. PiP, chroma-key, titling, adding music to video, basic keyframing, and motion tracking are all included. It isn't as feature-rich or speedy as some competitors, but it allows you to create appealing work quickly.

It's time to begin the post-production procedure when your video capture is finished, and your newly obtained film has been safely transferred from your camcorder to a hard disk. You may alter the audio file of your short video in any manner you like with the Movavi video editor.

**Step 1:** From the welcome box, choose to **Create a projec**t in full feature mode. When you're in the editor, click the **Add Media Files** button to incorporate the video and audio files you want to utilize in your new project.

**Step 2:** Every file you choose will be instantly placed on the Movavi timeline, with video files will appear on the Video Track and audio files on the **Audio Track**. To eliminate the unnecessary section of the audio file, click the **Split** option.

**Step 3**: Simply press **Start** and wait for your movie to be exported after selecting the correct video format and setting the destination folder by deciding on the **Save to** section.

**Conclusion**

Any video without some background soundtrack or any music, in general, appears to be at its 50% percent. Users tend to lose interest soon if they don't have something playing in the background all the time.

This is why the best Video Editor with Music reviewed in this article will ultimately do everything for you. From editing your videos and pictures, these apps are tailored to provide excellent functionality to any user. Decide on the one you liked based on the features and treat yourself to the best!
