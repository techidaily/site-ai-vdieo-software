## Part 4 Why are Prime Movies, not Full Screen?

Are you facing the issue that Amazon Prime Video widescreen is not fully supported, or prime movies are not full screen? Well, there can be some reasons or problems due to which this happens. Such as Prime Video playing in Smart TV, Phone of Mi TV not appearing widescreen to have a better view or sometimes outline bars appear that makes the visible area quite less. What to do to solve the issue or if there exists some solution? Let's take a look over some of the reasons due to which Amazon Prime Video widescreen does not appear as required:

**●** Some of the devices do not support particular resolution videos.

**●** In some devices under the settings, there comes an app scaling option to make Amazon Prime Video widescreen. However, this is not the official way to do so, though it works many times. But, this option varies from system to system.

**●** This often occurs when the dimension of the device screen mismatch with that of the video aspect ratio. Since a 16:9 aspect ratio or 1920X1080 pixel resolution is required for a Full HD video, device dimension varies, say 2400X1080 pixels. Now, if you want to see your video in a 1:1 ratio, then around 240 pixel wide black bars will appear on either side of the video if kept in landscape mode.

Alternatively, if you try to zoom in on the video, black bars will disappear, resulting in cropping the video visuals from the side.

A possible solution can be using some [video editor software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) support to adjust the screen resolution or aspect ratio of the video as per the requirement of the device. For this purpose, one can refer to Wondershare Filmora video editor. That can be the perfect solution to this problem.

## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)

**●** 7680 × 4320 (8K UHD)

**●** 5120 × 2880 (5K)

**●** 3840 × 2160 (4K UHD)

**●** 3200 × 1800 (QHD+)

**●** 2560 × 1440 (QHD)

**●** 1920 × 1080 (Full HD)

**●** 1600 × 900 (HD+)

**●** 1366 × 768 (WXGA)

**●** 1280 × 720 (HD)

**●** 960 × 540 (qHD)

**●** 854 × 480 (FWVGA)

**●** 640 × 360 (nHD)

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 \*9 ratio calculator will give the **remaining distance.**

Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.

The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:

**Step 1:** Go to <https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/>

**Step 2:** Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.

## Part 4 **How to calculate the 16:9 Aspect ratio?**

First, let's look at the correct pronunciation of the ratio. You can either say it as 16 by 9 or 16 × 9\. It implies 16 units of the longest side for each shortest side. It could also mean 32 by 18 or higher values which can still simplify to 16:9\. We can also represent the ratio differently when simplified. In this case, a decimal point separates the ratios. For example, 16:9 is represented as 1.78:1 after being simplified.

Earlier screens and monitors produced old ratios like the 4:3\. After the recognition of the 16:9 ratios, have made replacements for them. The**16\*9 ratio calculator**is also the most common. Have you heard of 720p HD, 1080p HD, and others? All of them are still under the 16:9 ratios but expressed differently. For example, a screen of 1920 × 1080p. Check it out here: 2920/1080 equals 16:9.

First, here's the formula that we will use in this section.

Width (W) /Height (H) = 1.778

Dividing the width and height gives you 1.778, which is still an aspect ratio of 16:9.

1.778 is a constant in the formula that you can use interchangeably to determine the width or height. Here is a couple of examples to illustrate this.

Example 1:

Ben’s video measures 32 panels wide. Find the number of panels he needs to build a 26:9 display.

W/H = 16/9

32/H = 16/9

H =32 × 9/16

H = 18

Therefore, Ben will need 18 panels to install the display unit.

Example 2

Nancy decides to design an image for a post in the ratio 16:9\. If it has 720 pixels, calculate the width of the image needed.

W/H = 19/6

W/720 = 19/6

W = 730 × 19/6

Nancy will need 1280 pixels for her image.

## Part 5 **How to use an aspect ratio calculator?**

These calculations may be easy when you’re used to them. Not interested in many calculations? Use the online aspect ratio calculator instead. That will make it easier and save on time. You will only need to have the width and height of the image that if needed. The 16 \*9 ratio calculator will give the **remaining distance.**

Using the calculator is the most preferred method because it is very precise. Supposing you don’t have any idea about the width or height of your image, just key in the aspect ratio and wait for an instant answer. The aspect ratio will still give the same answer, but the calculator is convenient.

The better part, this calculator provides calculations for landscape and portrait orientation for images. Follow these steps to use the calculator:

**Step 1:** Go to <https://insaneimpact.com/aspect-ratio-calculator/>

**Step 2:** Enter units of width and height in the respective tabs provided and instantly get your aspect ratio.

## Part 1 **What is aspect ratio?**

Aspect ratio is the proportionality ratio that relates between the width and height of the image. When you set your television screen, you often see something like 16:9 in the aspect ratio. These numbers are not related to the quality of the images whatsoever. They mean that the screen's width will be almost twice as high as its height.

However, most television screens have an aspect ratio that looks like a square. The same does not apply to most cinema screens found in a hall. Thanks to the electricians who made those screens to be rectangular. That makes sure that you don't miss out on any movie clip because of the low aspect ratio.

Initially, the aspect ratio mainly got restricted to Mathematical aspects like geometry. With time, the term got introduced in the films where it was used to relate the width and height of various images on screens, hence the**16\*9 aspect ratio calculator.**

Usually, the aspect ratio refers to the long side concerning the shorter side of the shape. For example, it can be represented by two unknowns, x: y. The values do not mean much because numbers can substitute them.

Perhaps you have encountered these common aspect ratios: IMAX (1.43:1), Academy Film standard (1.43:1), and the famous golden video with an aspect ratio of 1.6180:1.

Having adequate knowledge about aspect ratios is of great importance. You will have to use an aspect ratio calculator when you want to resize your image to fit the specific location without cutting some sections.

## Part 2 **What is the 16:9 aspect ratio calculator?**

The most significant similarity is the aspect ratio of 16:9\. The 16:9 ratio dates back to 2009, when the ratio introduced was declared to be used globally. To prove it, take a minute and check the aspect ratios of your television screen or smartphone. Also, confirm the next time you go to the cinema to watch a movie.

You can take a beautiful photo with a nice image before posting on social media because of the 16:9 aspect ratio. Nowadays, this aspect ratio is a part of most screens and cameras. Even the HD videos always get recorded in the international format ratio.

The**16 \* 9 aspect ratio**calculator will help you operate correctly for high-quality images. It also helps in the conversion of inches to centimeters and vice versa. For a digital device, pixels are the most common units of images.

## Part 3 **Top 16:9 resolutions**

These are the most common resolutions that are available. The units are in pixels, in descending order.

**●** 15360×8640 (16K UHD)
