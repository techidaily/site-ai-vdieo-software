When you are editing your videos with Adobe Premiere, you can use some useful Adobe Premiere tips to help you run the program faster and do the video editing more efficiently. Here the most useful 10 tips for using [Adobe Premiere Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and [Adobe Premiere Elements](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) are provided for your reference.

---

 This is a basic tutorial about Adobe Premiere, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Use the following Adobe Premiere tips to make your video editing easier and save time and energy. Make the process much easier than you had thought.

## Useful Adobe Premiere Pro and Elements tips

#### 1. Change the default settings

 You can save some time on video editing by changing two default settings: Scale Media to Project Size and Default Picture Length. You can go to Edit > Preferences > General to find the two settings. Scale Media to Project Size means any photo or video will be scaled down to the project size. This setting will save you a lot of time especially when you are mixing a lot of SD and HD video and photos. Default Picture Length originally is set at 150 frames or five seconds of footage. You can change it to any set mount so that you don't need to adjust every photo you import. When you finished the settings changing, hit "OK" to save.

#### 2.Capture video clips from your camcorder directly

 Remember that you don't need to transfer your camcorder videos to your hard drive first and then import the video clips to Adobe Premiere. When you have connected your camcorder or other video capture devices to your computer, set the camcorder to playback or set it in VCR mode. Then, in Adobe Premiere, start a new project and go to File > Capture to import your media from your camcorder directly. This will save your some time for Adobe Premiere video editing.

#### 3. Keep your project more organized with "Bins"

 You can click the "Folder" icon in the "Project" window to create a new folder to store video clips or other things. Store them in many different folders rather than only one so that you can find what you want more quickly. Create bins for storing separate audio, video, photo, etc. This Adobe Premiere tip will definitely makes your project more organized and can save time for editing.

#### 4. Create personalized video transitions

 When adding transition effects to videos, you can make some adjustments to the transition effects to make them more personalized. You can locate the transition effects in the "Effects" tab. And in the "Effect Controls" tab, you adjust the transitions such as changing the duration time, changing the entrance animation, etc.

#### 5. Choose the most suitable output video format

 Take the output video quality to consideration when creating a new project in Adobe Premier. For example, if you just want to share the videos on YouTube, then you don't need to create HD videos because it will take you much more time to upload the videos to Internet if they're HD videos. Besides, the HD videos also need much more storage space. Get the smaller video size with better compression and easily share your videos on Web.

#### 6. Quick render

 In Adobe Premiere, most effects and videos render in real time. To have a full preview of all the effects, you can press "Enter", which will render the project and enables you to preview the overall video effect in the "Monitor" window.

 Tip: Adobe Premiere is a very professional video editor and costs a lot. For a video editing beginner, it's better turn to some easy-to-use yet powerful video editor, say [Wondershare Filmora (originally Wondershare Video Editor)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which can help you burn to DVD directly and share to YouTube in several click. If you don't want to spend any money on video editing, you can also turn to some free video editing software like Windows Movie Maker or iMovie.

## Freeze, Rewind, Repeat: FCPX Time Manipulation Mastery

# Final Cut Pro X: Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

A very simple, yet very effective effect is changing the speed of a video clip. This could be a simple still-frame (also called "Freeze Frame") or playing a clip in slow or fast motion.

This article shows you how to do this using Final Cut Pro X.

For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: [Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion in Final Cut Pro X

#### 1\.  STILL FRAMES

![still frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg)

A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use "freeze-frame" and "still-frame" interchangeably.)

In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.

![freeze frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg)

This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.

![create freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg)

Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I'm making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.

![freeze frames in FCP X](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg)

In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.

Very cool, except....

Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can't change the location of the still frame.

So, here's another way to do this.

Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.

![Playhead](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg)

This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.

![match clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg)

Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.

As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type "M"), there's no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.

I use both these techniques in many different projects.

#### 2\.  HOLD FRAME

A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.

![hold frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg)

Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf-on-a-headset" Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).

![hold frames in fcp x](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg)

This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.

![create hold frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg)

Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.

![speed016](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg)

Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word "Hold" in the Retime Editor.

![speed018](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg)

To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.

NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!

#### 3\.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION

![fast/slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg)

We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what's called a "constant speed change," where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.

WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here's how.

![slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg)

Select the clip who's speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).

Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I'll show you how in a minute.)

![create slow/fast motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg)

Three things happen at once:

* The duration of the clip changes
* The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip
* The speed of the clip changes

![speed010](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg)

To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).

There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.

![speed017](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg)

The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.

Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.

![speed011](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg)

This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:

* Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.
* Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.
* Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.
* Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.

You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200\. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.

#### 4\.  EXTRA CREDIT

There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)

![speed012](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg)

Using, again, either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" menu, select Video Quality.

* Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.
* Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.
* Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.

Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.

Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.

For more tutorials on slow-motion please refer to this article: [Top 10 Slow Motion Video Editing Software.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Freeze-Frames and Slow Motion in Final Cut Pro X

#### 1\.  STILL FRAMES

![still frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed001.jpg)

A still-frame freezes action. For instance, here is a clip of a hummingbird getting ready to land on a bird feeder. I want to create a freeze-frame of the bird in flight. (Um, yeah, I use "freeze-frame" and "still-frame" interchangeably.)

In Final Cut Pro X, put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to freeze and type Option+F.

![freeze frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed002.jpg)

This creates a two-second freeze-frame at the position of the playhead.

![create freeze frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed003.jpg)

Adjust the duration of the frame by trimming the edge; just like any other clip. Here, for example, I'm making the duration of the freeze-frame 11 frames shorter.

![freeze frames in FCP X](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed004.jpg)

In case you were wondering, this is what the freeze looks like. It freezes the flight of the hummingbird in the middle of playback, allowing us to add graphics or other text then resume the action as though nothing had happened.

Very cool, except....

Well, the good news is that this is fast and easy. The bad news is that we can't change the location of the still frame.

So, here's another way to do this.

Put the playhead (or skimmer, but I prefer the playhead) on the frame you want to freeze, select the clip, then type Shift+F.

![Playhead](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed005.jpg)

This locates the source clip in the Browser, selects both the Browser and the clip, and matches the position of the In, Out, and playhead.

![match clips](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed006.jpg)

Now, with the Browser selected, type Option+F. This creates a freeze-frame of the Browser clip and places it at the location of the playhead as a connected clip in the Timeline.

As a connected clip, we can move this new freeze-frame wherever we want. However, be careful in moving the clip, because, unless you mark the original frame with a marker (type "M"), there's no easy way to match the still frame with the source frame, once the still frame is moved somewhere else.

I use both these techniques in many different projects.

#### 2\.  HOLD FRAME

A Hold Frame is similar to an in-line still frame, but with more flexibility.

![hold frame](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed013.jpg)

Put the playhead (or skimmer) on the frame you want to hold. Then, Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf-on-a-headset" Toolbar icon, choose Hold Frame (or type: Shift+H).

![hold frames in fcp x](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed014.jpg)

This displays the orange Retime editor bar above the clip, with a small red portion indicating the Hold frame.

![create hold frames](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed015.jpg)

Change the duration of the Hold frame by dragging the small thumb at the right end of the red bar.

![speed016](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed016.jpg)

Add a speed ramp transition at the end of the Hold frame by clicking the downward-pointing arrow next to the word "Hold" in the Retime Editor.

![speed018](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed018.jpg)

To change the actual frame being held, double-click the bar icon to the LEFT of the red Hold section and choose Source Frame (Edit). This allows you to slide the Hold frame selection left or right.

NOTE: Changing the source frame is a feature that I like a LOT!

#### 3\.  SLOW (or FAST) MOTION

![fast/slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed007.jpg)

We use slow-motion to show events that are too fast for the unaided eye to see. And fast motion to speed up very slow events. Both of these effects use what's called a "constant speed change," where the entire clip changes by the same amount - either faster or slower.

WE create either effect using the same tools, just different values. Here's how.

![slow motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed008.jpg)

Select the clip who's speed you want to change. Then, using either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" Toolbar icon, select Slow (or Fast).

Choose one of the available speeds; in this case, 50%. (Yes, you can change this to any value you want, I'll show you how in a minute.)

![create slow/fast motion](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed009.jpg)

Three things happen at once:

* The duration of the clip changes
* The orange Retiming bar appears over the top of the clip
* The speed of the clip changes

![speed010](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed010.jpg)

To reset the speed back to normal (100%), click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Normal (100%).

There are two ways to change the speed of a clip.

![speed017](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed017.jpg)

The easy way is to grab the small handle at the end of the clip and drag left or right. The speed will change as you drag it.

Or, for more precision, click the downward-pointing arrow in the Retiming bar and choose Custom.

![speed011](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed011.jpg)

This opens a new dialog allowing a number of changes:

* Reverse. Plays the clip in reverse.
* Rate. Select a specific speed change as a percentage of normal speed for a clip. Less than 100% is slow-motion. More than 100% is fast-motion.
* Duration. Select a specific duration for a clip and FCP X will calculate how fast or slow it needs to go.
* Ripple. When checked, adjusts the duration of a clip based upon the speed. When unchecked, the clip duration remains fixed even when speed changes.

You will get the smoothest speed changes when the percentage you choose divides evenly into 200\. For example, 100, 66, 50, 40, 33, 25, 20, 10 and so on.

#### 4\.  EXTRA CREDIT

There is one more setting to consider when slowing a clip. (This does not apply when creating fast motion.)

![speed012](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/speed012.jpg)

Using, again, either Modify > Retime or the "Smurf" menu, select Video Quality.

* Normal. This is the best choice for speeds of 50% or faster.
* Frame Blending. This is the best choice for speeds of about 20% to 50%.
* Optical Flow. This is the best choice for speeds slower than about 20%.

Frame blending puts a short dissolve between frames when running in slow motion to improve the illusion of motion. Optical Flow invents in-between frames to minimize the jerkiness of extremely slow motion.

Frame blending is relatively fast and easy. Optical Flow will look better in most cases, but takes a long time to render.

## How to Convert MP3 to MP4 Like a Pro: Expert Advice and Insights

##### What Should Consider when You Convert MP3 into MP4

An easy yet powerful editor

Numerous effects to choose from

Detailed tutorials provided by the official channel

[Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [Try It Free](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Keeping in mind that there will of course be no actual imagery to go with the finished product (unless you choose to add as such), converting an **MP3 into MP4** is very easy!

There are even online **MP3 to MP4 converters** that will allow you to do this without having to download or install anything! But, we're getting ahead of ourselves here. Continue reading below to learn more:

#### In this article

01 [Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP 4](#Part 1)

02 [Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter](#Part 2)

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)

**Step 2: Select 'MOV' Format!**

This is the step where things change, of course! Now, rather than choosing MP4, you should select the "MOV" format for your output type! This will ensure that your MP3 file is converted specifically to a MOV file.

![Select MOV output format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%206.png)

**Step 3: Convert!**

Again, just like before, select "CONVERT" to start the conversion process from **MP3 to MOV**!

![Select Conver or Convert All](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%207.png)

**Step 4: Open Folder to Find File!**

Then, finally, go to the "Finished" tab to find your new MOV file.

## Part 2 **Six Online and Free Mp3 to Mp4 Converter**

For this next section, we're going to introduce a couple of **online MP3 to MP4 converters** as well other general, paid, and **free MP3 to MP4 converters** that you can check out. A link to a video showing how the converter works, as well as brief descriptions for each converter, have also been provided to ensure that you have a good idea of how each one works!

### 01**[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)**

The first of the tools on this list is Filmora! Filmora, first and foremost, is an advanced video editor. Some might say that using it as a tool to simply convert **MP3 into MP4** is a little bit of an overkill.

But, chances are, you're not likely going to want to stop at converting your MP3 into an MP4 file anyway, right? Well, if that's the case, then having an all-in-one tool on your side that can offer you endless options for all sorts of purposes is one way to ensure that you are starting off on the right foot from the very beginning!

### 02Zamzar

Zamzar is a Windows 10 app that works as a general conversion tool. It doesn't just convert **MP3 into MP4** or **MP3 into MOV** — it also does the job if you're looking for a converter that will work on JPG to PNG or PDF to JPG, etc. That makes it a helpful tool to have on hand just for general conversion purposes.

### 03Online File Converter

Online File Converter, as you can probably guess from the name, is an online conversion tool! This tool, much like Zamzar, is a heavy-hitter when it comes to conversion inputs and outputs compatibility. So, not only are you able to do the general **MP3 into MP4** conversion promised today, but you can do other things as well! Plus, no download or installation is required! All you need is an internet connection to access the website the converter is on and a little patience while you wait to upload, convert, and download the file in question.

### 04Any Conv

AnyConv is an alternate to the Online File Converter if you're looking for an online solution, but you don't like the interface of one or the other. The two are pretty much identical in terms of features. All you need to do in order to use it is to upload the file that you want to convert, choose a format, and then download the output file when you're done!

### 05Uniconverter

Uniconverter is an online **MP3 to MP4** tool from Wondershare (the same creators of Filmora Pro). It's a very solid tool. And it's quite a convenient one too. Since, just like any online converter, all you need to start using it is an internet connection.

### 06MConverter - Chrome Extension

Our last pick brings us back to unique solutions! Specifically, we're delving into the realm of Chrome extensions! This tool, the MConverter, works similarly to the other converters on this list. But, of course, in this case, if you want to use it in order to convert your files, you must first download the plug-in to your Chrome browser!

## Key Takeaways from This Episode

**●** Despite the variety of options out there for **MP3 into MP4** converters, they all pretty much work the same. First, you upload the file that you want to convert. Second, you select the output format for the conversion. And finally, third, you finish the conversion!

**●** Most MP3 to MP4 converters work for other formats as well. For example, if you want to convert your **MP3 to MOV** instead — that's possible! OR, if you want to do the opposite, and convert **MP4 to MP3**, that works too!

**●** The difference between the different audio-to-video converters is usually the type of extra features it comes with as well as from what platform you can use it. For the latter, there are software types that you download and install to your computer, online types that you access through the internet, and extensions that you plug into your browser! Pick the one that works best with your workflow.

## Part 1 **Easy Steps on Convert MP3 into MP4**

For the first part of this article, we'll be covering how to use a **free** **MP3 to MP4 converter** in order to successfully change the format of your audio into a video file! There will be two examples given for this, one for the straightforward **MP3 into MP4** conversion the other for the more specified **MP3 to MOV** conversion!

### 01How to Convert MP3 to MP4?

**Step 1: Launch MP3 to MP4 Convert (for Windows)**

For our example, we'll be using the **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, EaseUS Video Converter! This is open-source software, so you can use it for free!

To start using your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, upload the file that you want to convert! For our example converter, it's as simple as dragging and dropping your chosen MP3 into the interface (as pointed out in the image below.)

![Launch MP3 to MP4 Converter](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%201.png)

**Step 2: Choose Output Format!**

Once the MP3 file has been uploaded, choose your desired output format.

(For our example **MP3 to MP4 converter**, this means selecting the settings icon for the file in question and then choosing a format from the pop-up window that appears (shown in the image below).

![Choose MP4 Output Format](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%202.png)

**Step 3: Start Converting!**

Once you've chosen your desired output format (which in this case is **MP3 into MP4**), select the "CONVERT" button to finish up!

![Convert MP3 into MP4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%203.png)

**Step 4: Save MP3 Into MP4**

Depending on your chosen **free MP3 to MP4 converter**, your new MP4 file may have to be downloaded manually or not.

In the case of EaseUS Video Converter, it is downloaded automatically, all you have to do is select the "Finished" tab and select "OPEN" to go directly to the file location.

![Open Finished MP4 File](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%204.png)

### 02How to Convert MP3 to MOV?

We've also included how you can convert **MP3 to MOV** with the same tool! As you will surely see, much of the process is the same. Only one step is really changed!

**Step 1: Uploaded MP3 File!**

First, just like in the previous section, upload your MP3 file (by dragging and dropping the file onto the **MP3 to MOV** converter.)

![Choose Files for Upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/01/what-should-consider-when-you-convert-mp3-to-mp4%205.png)
