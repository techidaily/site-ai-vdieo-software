The size of the videos you capture with your Smartphone or digital camera can sometimes be just too large for online use. Videos recorded in Full HD or **4K resolutions** can take hours to upload to any of the video file hosting services and they often exceed the **video** **size limitations on social media networks.**

PC owners who often upload video content to their social media accounts or run a YouTube channel can **easily compress their footage on Windows 10**. There are a number of options that enable you to reduce the size of a video on the latest version of the Windows OS, but which one you are going to choose depends on a number of factors that range from your preferred method of reducing a video file’s size to how fast the compression process is.

In this article, we are going to take you through **nine best free video compressors for Windows 10** and help you discover the one you feel comfortable using.

* [Part 1: 9 Best Free Video Compressors for Windows 10](#part1)

### 2.[Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4#activetab=pivot:overviewtab)

When done, you should click on the **Finish** **video** **button** and choose from **Small, Medium or Large** output video size before you start the video exporting.

You can either convert a file **by changing its output file format, adjusting the bitrate and the frame rate** or by cropping and recording segments of the video clip you want to compress.

The fastest and easiest way to reduce a video’s size in VCL is to change its file format. You can do this by clicking on the **Convert/Save option** in the **Media menu**. You can then select one of the available profile presets from the **Profile drop-down menu** and select the option that is best suited for the context in which the video is going to be used. Optionally, you can click on the **Settings icon** next to the Profile drop-down menu in case you would like to adjust a video’s resolution manually.

Stop motion animation is becoming more and more popular by the year, and it’s not surprising. This style of making animated films is done by taking objects, either dolls with joints or soft clay items, and manipulating them. The physical manipulations and changes are then photographed. Each photograph acts as a frame, and when you play the frames together quickly, it looks like the objects have been animated.

If you want to make this type of animation, then you want to find the best **stop motion animation software** that you can find. Some options out there are even free! In this article, we’re going to share the 8 best options for stop motion animation software, separating them by whether they are for Mac or PC.
