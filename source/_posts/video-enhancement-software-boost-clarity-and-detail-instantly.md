Cartooning a photo is a simple and yet effective way of enhancing a picture and making it more visually appealing. Besides adding an artistic touch to portraits you take, cartooning a photo can also be a great way to have fun with your friends because the results of picture cartooning can be as entertaining as visually striking.

Besides portraiture, this visual effect can be applied to virtually any other genre of photography, although the contents of the shoot usually determine how well the effect is going to work. Whatâ€™s more, you donâ€™t need a [professional video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to cartoon a photo, since there are so many websites that let you apply this effect to your photos for free.

Thatâ€™s why we selected some of the best websites for converting a photo into a cartoon.

Once youâ€™ve uploaded a photo, you just have to go to the Effects menu and select the Cartoon option. Lunapic will then automatically apply the effect to the photo you uploaded and you just need to preview the image before you save it. The only downside is that you canâ€™t adjust the effectâ€™s settings in case you donâ€™t like the results.

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take â€“** Donâ€™t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more â€“** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Donâ€™t improvise, make a script â€“** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what youâ€™re good at â€“** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, donâ€™t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Donâ€™t forget your audience â€“** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they donâ€™t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

## Part 2: What should be included in a video resume?

In essence, there is no difference between a video resume and a paper resume, which are means of obtaining an interview. So, in the video resume, the following information should be included as well:

**Education background:** When recording video resumes, briefly introduce the educational experience and qualifications, the majors and graduates, and the specific skills and abilities if necessary.

**Work experience:** Focus on past jobs and positions and achievements.

**Training experience:** What kind of skills training did you participate in, and what benefits do you get from it?

**Job intention:** which position youâ€™re applying for, and why do you want to this job. You can state it from your majors and your future career plans.

**Concluding remarks:**  you can end your resume recording with sentences like Thank you for watching my resume and looking forward to the opportunity to get an interview.

## Part 3: How to Make a video resume with Filmora?

## Part 4: Tips That Are Going to Help You Make a Better Video Resume

Creating your first video resume can be an intimidating task, so here are a few tips that will help you go through the process smoothly.

**Relax, you can always do another take â€“** Donâ€™t panic if at first, you have a tough time remembering your lines. Just relax, because the shot is going to look much better if you act naturally.

**Less is more â€“** Respect the time of your potential employers by keeping your video resume short. Video resumes that last between one and two minutes often produce the best results.

**Donâ€™t improvise, make a script â€“** Put your ideas on paper, that will make them much easier to remember once the camera starts rolling.

**Focus on what youâ€™re good at â€“** You have a limited amount of time to explain why you are the right candidate for the job, donâ€™t waste that time on talking about your weaknesses.

**Donâ€™t forget your audience â€“** Try to understand what the people who are going to watch the video like and what they donâ€™t like. If you manage to do this, your video resume is going to grab the attention of its viewers.

## Part 5: Creative Video Resumes Examples

You can find more videos about Video Resume on YouTube, and Iâ€™ve selected some creative ones so you can have a quick look.
