Choosing a meme generator is not easy because there are simply too many great apps for both iOS and Android devices that let you have complete control over the entire process of generating a meme. We've selected the 12 best options that are currently available on GooglePlay and AppStore.

#### 1. [GATM Meme Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iddqd.gatm)

**Compatibility:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/GATM-meme-generator-android-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful meme generator this app also offers an easy way to discover new memes. The browsable content is updated daily, so you'll always be in touch with the latest meme trends.

The app features a huge template library, and you can upload your own images too. The GATM Meme Generator can be downloaded for free, but the text formatting tools offer only basic options. All generated memes are watermark-free and they can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, or numerous other social media platforms directly from the app.

#### 2. [Mematic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![Meme Maker App](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mematic> -the-meme-maker.jpg)

Over 100.000 installs on Google Play show just how good this meme generator really is. Mematic is designed to create memes quickly and effortlessly, so you can just add captions and share the meme with your friends.

The app only offers basic text formatting tools, and there are no photo editing options. However, downloading Mematic for free will enable you to gain access to hundreds of classic meme pictures to which you can add your captions. The app's interface is intuitive so you won't have any problems making memes, even if you never used the Mematic app before.

#### 3. [Memedroid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8)

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memedroid-funny-memes-gif-maker.jpg)

Memedroid is both a meme generator and a community of people who enjoy a good laugh. It features a rich meme template library and just basic text tools. There are very few extra features other than support for uploading your own images and GIFs.

Despite this, the Memedroid app is a great source of new meme templates because the gallery is constantly updated. If you decide to install this app on your device, be prepared to deal with annoying ads on a regular basis. Don't be too surprised if the app crashes while you are browsing through the latest memes.

#### 4. [ZomboDroid's Meme Generator Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.MemeGenerator&hl=en)

**Compatibility** **:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ZomboDroid-meme-generator-free.jpg)

Neatly organized memes into separate categories, stickers, excellent file sharing features, and memes without watermarks are only a few reasons why the Meme Generator Free app is so popular. As its name suggests, you don't have to pay anything to install the app and use its library that has over 700 memes.

You can choose the size of the header and footer, use a font you like, or crop images in just a few easy steps. The only unpleasant thing about this app is the ads because every other option makes the meme-generating process fun.

#### 5. [Tumblr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tumblr-make-memes.jpg)

Tumblr is a social network, so you can create an account and post images and videos on your profile. The app for iPhones and Android Smartphones features a GIF editor as well as photo editing options. You can customize text by selecting the font, the size and the color or add as many stickers as you want to your memes.

Besides memes, you can use Tumblr to discover all types of images from pet photos to cars or fashion photos. All memes must be first posted to this social network before they can be shared on your other social media channels.

#### 6. [ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.videogifmemefreegplay&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android

The coolest memes are always GIFs, and if you want a powerful app that lets you manipulate moving and still images then ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes is one of the best options. You can customize the text in any way you want while the app also lets you combine videos, GIFs, and photos into a single file.

The library contains millions of GIFs you can freely use to create your own hilarious memes. You can control the frame rate, speed or repetition of each GIF you edit with this incredibly fun app.

#### 7. [Meme Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gentoozero.memecreator)

**Compatibility:** Android

Curate your own collection of memes or create new memes using the Meme Creator's rich library that contains over 600 memes. The color of the captions and their size can be easily adjusted to meet your aesthetic demands. There are more than 20 different fonts available and you can also combine memes to create comics.

Meme Creator lets you share memes on all popular online destinations, which makes it a great choice for all Android owners who post fresh content every day on multiple social media profiles.

#### 8. [Meme Producer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-producer-free-meme-maker-generator/id560797323?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

Share memes in three simple steps. Choose a picture, add a caption and share a meme on any popular social media platform. Meme Producer lets you combine several images in a single meme and enables you to change a caption with a single tap.

Captions generated with this app can have more than one line, which is great if the text you want to add contains more than two sentences. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore and it contains no ads or watermarks.

#### 9. [Modern Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dinizthiagobrdev.ModernMemeMaker)

**Compatibility:** Android

The app lets you browse and use over 200 free meme templates. You just have to select the meme you like and decide which color or the size the text is going to be. You don't have to worry about the length of the caption because the multi-line feature is available.

If you want, you can add watermarks to memes, although watermarked memes are not particularly popular. The best part is that Modern Meme Maker supports Instagram's upload requirements, while it also lets you share memes on Twitter or Tumblr.

#### 10. [Make a Meme +](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-a-meme+/id513930217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want. A good meme generator app will help you forget about the technical side of the meme-making process so you can focus on what is truly important. What's your favorite meme generator app for iOS or Android devices? Wanna be more creative in making memes and level up your video editing experience, download Filmora for free and make memes and videos with fun.

## 10 Best Meme Generator Apps for Android and iOS

Choosing a meme generator is not easy because there are simply too many great apps for both iOS and Android devices that let you have complete control over the entire process of generating a meme. We've selected the 12 best options that are currently available on GooglePlay and AppStore.

#### 1. [GATM Meme Generator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=iddqd.gatm)

**Compatibility:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/GATM-meme-generator-android-app.jpg)

Besides being a powerful meme generator this app also offers an easy way to discover new memes. The browsable content is updated daily, so you'll always be in touch with the latest meme trends.

The app features a huge template library, and you can upload your own images too. The GATM Meme Generator can be downloaded for free, but the text formatting tools offer only basic options. All generated memes are watermark-free and they can be shared on Facebook, Twitter, or numerous other social media platforms directly from the app.

#### 2. [Mematic](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.trilliarden.mematic&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

![Meme Maker App](<https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mematic> -the-meme-maker.jpg)

Over 100.000 installs on Google Play show just how good this meme generator really is. Mematic is designed to create memes quickly and effortlessly, so you can just add captions and share the meme with your friends.

The app only offers basic text formatting tools, and there are no photo editing options. However, downloading Mematic for free will enable you to gain access to hundreds of classic meme pictures to which you can add your captions. The app's interface is intuitive so you won't have any problems making memes, even if you never used the Mematic app before.

#### 3. [Memedroid](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/memedroid-funny-memes-gifs/id549014460?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memedroid-funny-memes-gif-maker.jpg)

Memedroid is both a meme generator and a community of people who enjoy a good laugh. It features a rich meme template library and just basic text tools. There are very few extra features other than support for uploading your own images and GIFs.

Despite this, the Memedroid app is a great source of new meme templates because the gallery is constantly updated. If you decide to install this app on your device, be prepared to deal with annoying ads on a regular basis. Don't be too surprised if the app crashes while you are browsing through the latest memes.

#### 4. [ZomboDroid's Meme Generator Free](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.MemeGenerator&hl=en)

**Compatibility** **:** Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ZomboDroid-meme-generator-free.jpg)

Neatly organized memes into separate categories, stickers, excellent file sharing features, and memes without watermarks are only a few reasons why the Meme Generator Free app is so popular. As its name suggests, you don't have to pay anything to install the app and use its library that has over 700 memes.

You can choose the size of the header and footer, use a font you like, or crop images in just a few easy steps. The only unpleasant thing about this app is the ads because every other option makes the meme-generating process fun.

#### 5. [Tumblr](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tumblr)

**Compatibility:** iOS, Android

![Meme Maker App](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tumblr-make-memes.jpg)

Tumblr is a social network, so you can create an account and post images and videos on your profile. The app for iPhones and Android Smartphones features a GIF editor as well as photo editing options. You can customize text by selecting the font, the size and the color or add as many stickers as you want to your memes.

Besides memes, you can use Tumblr to discover all types of images from pet photos to cars or fashion photos. All memes must be first posted to this social network before they can be shared on your other social media channels.

#### 6. [ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zombodroid.videogifmemefreegplay&hl=en)

**Compatibility:** Android

The coolest memes are always GIFs, and if you want a powerful app that lets you manipulate moving and still images then ZomboDroid's Video and GIF Memes is one of the best options. You can customize the text in any way you want while the app also lets you combine videos, GIFs, and photos into a single file.

The library contains millions of GIFs you can freely use to create your own hilarious memes. You can control the frame rate, speed or repetition of each GIF you edit with this incredibly fun app.

#### 7. [Meme Creator](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gentoozero.memecreator)

**Compatibility:** Android

Curate your own collection of memes or create new memes using the Meme Creator's rich library that contains over 600 memes. The color of the captions and their size can be easily adjusted to meet your aesthetic demands. There are more than 20 different fonts available and you can also combine memes to create comics.

Meme Creator lets you share memes on all popular online destinations, which makes it a great choice for all Android owners who post fresh content every day on multiple social media profiles.

#### 8. [Meme Producer](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/meme-producer-free-meme-maker-generator/id560797323?mt=8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

Share memes in three simple steps. Choose a picture, add a caption and share a meme on any popular social media platform. Meme Producer lets you combine several images in a single meme and enables you to change a caption with a single tap.

Captions generated with this app can have more than one line, which is great if the text you want to add contains more than two sentences. The app can be downloaded for free from the AppStore and it contains no ads or watermarks.

#### 9. [Modern Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dinizthiagobrdev.ModernMemeMaker)

**Compatibility:** Android

The app lets you browse and use over 200 free meme templates. You just have to select the meme you like and decide which color or the size the text is going to be. You don't have to worry about the length of the caption because the multi-line feature is available.

If you want, you can add watermarks to memes, although watermarked memes are not particularly popular. The best part is that Modern Meme Maker supports Instagram's upload requirements, while it also lets you share memes on Twitter or Tumblr.

#### 10. [Make a Meme +](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/make-a-meme+/id513930217?mt=8&ign-mpt=uo%3D8)

**Compatibility:** iOS

With more than 4 million users and an extensively long list of memes, this app is among the very best meme generators for iPhones. Changing the text requires you to just tap on a meme you like, while you can also add faces or hats to images you're editing.

The text formatting tools are not as powerful as you'd expect from an app that offers so many other cool features. All images can either be saved to the camera roll or shared on Facebook, Instagram, and other popular online destinations.

---

#### **Conclusion:**

Making a meme is about imagination, and having a sense of humor, but you also need a powerful tool that lets you express your ideas in the exact way you want. A good meme generator app will help you forget about the technical side of the meme-making process so you can focus on what is truly important. What's your favorite meme generator app for iOS or Android devices?

In addition, if you opt for the free version of Picovico, all videos you create are going to be watermarked, and their quality and duration are going to be limited.

#### 5. [Pholody](https://www.pholody.com/editor)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/pholody-image-to-video-online.jpg)

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MP3Care-image-to-video-online.jpg)

The maximum number of photos you can use in a video is limited to just **twenty**, while the maximum duration of each image in the video canâ€™t exceed the **20-second** mark. Adding transitions between pictures is also on the list of options this platform provides, but Mp3 Care Photo to Video lacks any other video editing features.

Additionally, you also use Movie Maker Online to search for free music you can use in your videos without having to worry about the copyrights. The platformâ€™s interface, however, is far from perfect and it may take you some time to get used to it and figure out how to add text to the photos youâ€™re using in your video or how to choose for how long a photo is going to be displayed on the screen.

#### 9. [Slideshow Photos](https://slideshow.photos/)

**Price:** Free

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/slide-show-online-image-to-video-online.jpg)

However, you will have to install the latest version of Adobeâ€™s Flash Player in order to use this platform, so make sure that this software is updated before you start creating a new slideshow with it. If you choose one of the subscription plans, you will be able to enhance each photo you include in your slideshow, before you export it to social media.

#### 11. [Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/make/slideshow-maker/)

**Price:** Free, Available through Adobe Creative Cloud Plan for $52.99 per month or as a stand-alone app for $9.99 per month

![ Image to Video online maker ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/image-to-video-online-adobe-spark.jpg)

Fortunately, we have the best solutions to fix the skin tone issue by using FCPXâ€™s built-in tools or smooth skin plugins.

Now, letâ€™s understand what a skin smoother effect is before learning how to add it in FCPX.

## Part 1: How to Add a Skin Smoother Effect without Plugins in Final Cut Pro?

Smoothening the skin in Final Cut Pro is very simple. Simply select the video, choose Video effects to be applied, and adjust the percentages from the Inspector pane. You will get wrinkle-free skin with an astonishing look. While multiple plugins are also available to apply a skin smoother effect, you can use the built-in features of Final Cut Pro to smoothen the skin and decrease the amount of contrast.

Hereâ€™s how you can do this:

step1Choose the starting image and edit the clip into the timeline. Press Option and make a connected copy of the clip by dragging it up. The start and end points should match for syncing. In the Effects Browser, drag Blur > Gaussian Blur to apply the blur effect on the upper clip.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_1.jpg)

step2Open the Inspector pan and select Compositing from its bottom. Switch the Blend Mode to Lighten and adjust the Opacity slider as per your desired glow. Usually, 40 to 45% is ideal.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_2.jpg)

step3Now, go to the top of the Inspector and turn on the blue checkbox next to Gaussian. Adjust the blurring effect until you achieve your desired level of skin softening. It is highly recommended to blur using the horizontal setting to soften the skin while keeping the eyes sharp. Here, the glow is controlled by Opacity while skin softening is controlled by the Blue Amount.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_3.jpg)

For better results, add a Vignette by selecting and combining the two clips into a Compound Clip. From the Effects Browser, select Stylize > Vignette and adjust drag the vignette. Now, customize the compound clip settings in the Inspector pane until you achieve your desired look. Compare the results between two images before and after editing

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 5: How to smooth skin in Adobe Pro?

Given below are simple steps to create a face matter, control the skin smoothing, adjust color correction, and correct the skin glow in Adobe Pro by using the Beauty Studio Effect:

1. Applying the Beauty Studio effect smoothens all parts of the image including the background. However, it will make your footage look artificial, which is not desired. Hence, turn on the Pixel Chooser, pick two colors with the eye dropper tool. Color A for the darker area and Color B for the lighter area.
2. Underneath the Mocha Matte, use the eyedropper tool to select colors on the skin of the subject in your footage.
3. Now, click on View Matte/Mask to visualize the image areas where you are applying the skin smoothing effect. The Beauty Studio will affect the smoothing effect in the white area while the black area will remain unsmoothed.
4. Adjust the Saturation, Hue, and Luma softness to enhance the appearance of the skin, eyes, and mouth.
5. To prevent the rest of the image from getting affected, create a Mocha mask around the face by clicking on the Mocha logo and drawing a mask with the X-Spline tool. Make sure the mask moves as the subject is moved after your track forward and back.
6. Beauty Studio offers four levels of skin smoothing. You can adjust these levels as per your situation by lowering the smoothing amount for each level. For better results, adjust the levels at 70 or below.
7. For the final touch, adjust the sharpening between 10-20 points, add saturation between 3 to 8 points for color correction, and add 5 to 10 points of glow. Your image is ready, compare the results before and after applying the effect.

**Conclusion**

Smooth skin with clear facial expressions attracts everyone. You can apply a skin smooth effect in your video by using advanced video editing tools like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premium, and Wondershare Filmora.

There are two methods to add a skin smooth effect with FCPX: By using in-built software settings, or by using plugins like Skin Smoother 2, Color Finale, and Universe. Use Beauty Studio Effect in Adobe Pro to smooth skin and improve facial appearance. Finally, you can beautify the face in your video by adding transitions, making color adjustments, and applying different effects with Wondershare Filmora.

Hence, turn on the Pixel Chooser, pick two colors with the eye dropper tool. Color A for the darker area and Color B for the lighter area.
2. Underneath the Mocha Matte, use the eyedropper tool to select colors on the skin of the subject in your footage.
3. Now, click on View Matte/Mask to visualize the image areas where you are applying the skin smoothing effect. The Beauty Studio will affect the smoothing effect in the white area while the black area will remain unsmoothed.
4. Adjust the Saturation, Hue, and Luma softness to enhance the appearance of the skin, eyes, and mouth.
5. To prevent the rest of the image from getting affected, create a Mocha mask around the face by clicking on the Mocha logo and drawing a mask with the X-Spline tool. Make sure the mask moves as the subject is moved after your track forward and back.
6. Beauty Studio offers four levels of skin smoothing. You can adjust these levels as per your situation by lowering the smoothing amount for each level. For better results, adjust the levels at 70 or below.
7. For the final touch, adjust the sharpening between 10-20 points, add saturation between 3 to 8 points for color correction, and add 5 to 10 points of glow. Your image is ready, compare the results before and after applying the effect.

**Conclusion**

Smooth skin with clear facial expressions attracts everyone. You can apply a skin smooth effect in your video by using advanced video editing tools like Final Cut Pro, Adobe Premium, and Wondershare Filmora.

There are two methods to add a skin smooth effect with FCPX: By using in-built software settings, or by using plugins like Skin Smoother 2, Color Finale, and Universe. Use Beauty Studio Effect in Adobe Pro to smooth skin and improve facial appearance. Finally, you can beautify the face in your video by adding transitions, making color adjustments, and applying different effects with Wondershare Filmora.

## Part 1: How to Add a Skin Smoother Effect without Plugins in Final Cut Pro?

Smoothening the skin in Final Cut Pro is very simple. Simply select the video, choose Video effects to be applied, and adjust the percentages from the Inspector pane. You will get wrinkle-free skin with an astonishing look. While multiple plugins are also available to apply a skin smoother effect, you can use the built-in features of Final Cut Pro to smoothen the skin and decrease the amount of contrast.

Hereâ€™s how you can do this:

step1Choose the starting image and edit the clip into the timeline. Press Option and make a connected copy of the clip by dragging it up. The start and end points should match for syncing. In the Effects Browser, drag Blur > Gaussian Blur to apply the blur effect on the upper clip.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_1.jpg)

step2Open the Inspector pan and select Compositing from its bottom. Switch the Blend Mode to Lighten and adjust the Opacity slider as per your desired glow. Usually, 40 to 45% is ideal.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_2.jpg)

step3Now, go to the top of the Inspector and turn on the blue checkbox next to Gaussian. Adjust the blurring effect until you achieve your desired level of skin softening. It is highly recommended to blur using the horizontal setting to soften the skin while keeping the eyes sharp. Here, the glow is controlled by Opacity while skin softening is controlled by the Blue Amount.

![Skin_Smoother_Effect_3](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/Skin_Smoother%20Effect_3.jpg)

For better results, add a Vignette by selecting and combining the two clips into a Compound Clip. From the Effects Browser, select Stylize > Vignette and adjust drag the vignette.
