## Part 2: Tips for Choosing Professional Video Editing Software

### 1\. Check your computer specification and performance before purchasing

Professional video editing software may use lots of resources. It is recommended that you check computer specification and the system requirements of the professional editing software that you want to purchase.

To get the full experience of professional video editing, your computer would be better to equipped higher than meeting the mini requirements.

### 2\. How to master the professional video editing software

If you have limited video editing experience and want to become a professional video editor, it is recommended to spend time in editing and take some training or course to master it.

You can find many tutorials about Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Final Cut Pro X on YouTube. Or, you can attain online courses on Udemy or Lynda. If you want to convince people that you are a professional video editor, it is recommended to take some certifications.

As you may know that Adobe and Apple both provide official certification exams. A certification will be more convincing when people doubt your editing skills.

### 3\. What should I consider before going for a Pro video editor

If you are reading this line, you can ask yourself a question '**what intrigues me to choose a pro video editor? It is because you see other professional YouTuber using them? Do I have the time to learn these professional video editors?**;' If it is the case, you should consider the price you're paying and whether those high-end features and functions are the things you'll need.

With its **extremely low-learning-curve and user-friendly interface**, Filmora can deal with **95%** of your video editing needs with **just $49.99 per year.** With Filmora, you don't have to spend time on a boring guide and you can do video editing right away since everything is designed for this purpose.
