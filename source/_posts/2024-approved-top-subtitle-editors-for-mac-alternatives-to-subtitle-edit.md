There exists some software that is almost similar to Subtitle Edit. And given that there is no option to download Subtitle Edit for Mac users — you can use its alternative and utilize the same features on a macOS environment.

### 2\. Jubler

Another free software, Jubler, is also a viable alternative to Subtitle Edit.
