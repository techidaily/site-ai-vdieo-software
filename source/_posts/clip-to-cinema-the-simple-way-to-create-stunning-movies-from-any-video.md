## MP4 to MP3 Conversion Made Easy: Best Software and Online Tools

# MP4 2 MP3: Best MP4 to MP3 Converters

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

The MP4 file format is probably the most commonly used video file format today, as various video recording devices use it as the default video file format. The duration of a video and the resolution in which a video was captured determine its size, so the size of an MP4 file can vary between a couple of hundred of megabytes to a couple of gigabytes. That’s why there is no reason to store huge MP4 files if you only need their audio since converting this type of file to an MP3 file format is a simple process. Read on if you would like to learn more about the best MP4 to MP3 converters you can use online or on PC and Mac computers.

## Best Mac and PC-based MP4 to MP3 Converters

Both Mac and PC users have a broad range of free software products at their disposal that enable them to convert MP4 video file to MP3 audio files. So, let's take a look at some of the easiest ways to turn MP4 to MP3 on a Mac or a PC.

### 1\. Using Filmora to Convert MP4 to MP3 Files

Filmora is a powerful video editing software that is compatible with both macOS and Windows operating systems. Besides offering a plethora of video editing tools you can use to create green-screen videos, stabilize shaky footage captured with action cameras or make the Picture-in-Picture effect, Filmora also lets you edit audio files with ease. The built-in library of royalty-free music and audio effects enables you to create compelling soundtracks for each of your videos, while its Denoise feature helps you reduce background noise in audio files. Converting an MP4 to MP3 in Filmora is a quick process that won’t take much longer than a couple of minutes. Here’s how you can convert an MP4 to MP3 with Filmora.

![Filmora9 Export MP4 as MP3 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-mp3-9-win.jpg)

After you’ve created a new project, you should head over to the editor’s **Media Panel** to import the MP4 video file you’d like to turn into an MP3 audio file. The file you imported into a project in Filmora will be displayed in the Media Panel and you should simply **drag and drop it to the timeline**. After you’ve placed the MP4 file to the video track on the timeline, you should click on **the Export button**.

The Export window will appear on the screen and you just have to **select MP3 as the preferred output format** and click on the **Export button**. The rendering process will start immediately, but its duration depends on the size and the quality settings you’ve chosen. Filmora lets you create high-quality MP3 audio files from MP4 video files which makes it a great choice for a broad range of users.

**Pros**

### 2\. Converting MP4 to MP3 Files With Windows Media Player For Free

All recent versions of the Windows OS come bundled with the Windows Media Player that lets you play both video and audio files. In order to start converting MP4 to MP3 files you must first **open the MP4 file** with Windows Media Player, so just click on the **File drop-down menu**, choose the **Open option** and select the MP4 file you’d like to open. The video filed you opened will start playing and you have to click on the **Menu button** to access the player’s home screen.

Once the home screen loads, you should click on the **Organize drop-down** menu that is located in the upper left corner of the screen and **select Options**. Click on the **Rip Music tab** in the Options window that appeared on the screen and then use **the Change icon** to select the destination on your hard drive where the converted file is going to be saved.

![Windows Media Player Save MP4 as MP3 ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-media-player-mp4-mp3.jpg)

Directly below you will be able to see the **Rip Settings section of the tab**, click on the **Format drop-down menu** and select the **MP3 option**. Hit the **OK button** to commence the conversion process, and wait for your MP4 file to be converted into an MP3 file.

**Pros**

### 3\. Using the iTunes Library to Convert MP4 to MP3 Files

iTunes is probably one of the best media players ever created so it is hardly a surprise that you can use it as an MP4 to MP3 converter. You just have to add an MP4 file you’d like to convert into an MP3 to iTunes Library by clicking on the **File menu** and selecting **Add File to Library** option. Browse the computer’s hard drive until you find the file you want to add to the library and **click OK** to complete the process.

The MP4 file will be placed in the iTunes’ **Music category**, and you just have to click on it to select it. Head back to the File menu and choose the **Create MP3 Version** option from the **Convert submenu**. The conversion process will commence immediately and once it is completed you can play your freshly created MP3 file directly from iTunes.

**Pros**

* iTunes makes it easy to organize MP3 files
* The speedy file conversion process

**Cons**

* Converting large quantities of MP4 files to MP3 can be time-consuming

### 4\. Converting MP4 to MP3 Files on Windows, macOS, and Linux with VLC Player

VLC is an open-source player that enables you to play a broad range of audio and video files. It also offers some video editing and file conversion functionality that allows its users to apply effects and filters or change the format of audio and video files.

Go to the **Media menu** and click on the **Convert/Save option** or use the **Ctrl+R** keyboard shortcut to bring up the **Open Media** window. Under **File Selection**, click on the **Add icon** and proceed to choose the MP4 file you want to convert. At the bottom of this window, you’ll be able to see the **Convert/Save button**, click on it and wait for the **Convert window** to appear on the screen.
