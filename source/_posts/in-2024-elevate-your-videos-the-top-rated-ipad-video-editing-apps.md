As we all know, the online realm is filled with lots of video editing tools that claim to be the best. But the truth is not all of them live up to their claims. In this article we will walk you through the best video editing software that's worth your money. Thus, scroll down to find the five best iPad Pro Video Editor of 2024\.

* [**Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad**](#part1)
* [**Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora**](#part2)
* [**Part 3: FAQ**](#part3)

## Part 1: 5 Best Video Editing Apps for iPad

### 1\. Filmora (Recommended)

Available for iOS (i.e., for iPad) and Android users, [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is the most viable option if you want to take your videos to the next level from your mobile screens. The easy-to-use interface allows even the naivest users to adapt the video skills quickly plus it being easy-on-eyes also enables you to edit videos seamlessly. Given the dedicated options for everything — tripping & cutting videos to adding audio, photos, and subtitles — editing videos will not take time.

[![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/google_play.jpg) ](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6) [![Download filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/apple_store.jpg)](https://app.adjust.com/w06dr6m%5F19za1f6)

**Pros:**

* You can set duration of video motion
* Filmora includes all the basic video-editing features you might expect, like cutting, merging, cropping, and rotating video footage

**Cons:**

* Filmora does have a free version, but the video will be watermarked

**Price:**

**Free version available**

Filmora Pro (1 Year) — $32.99

Filmora Pro （1 Month） — $6.99

Remove Logo Roll — $4.99more

### 2\. LumaFusion (best for iPad)

Recommended for iPad users, LumaFusion is a multitrack mobile video editor used by professionals. However, unlike Filmora, LumaFusion does not make it simple for an average Joe to utilize the application to its full extent. In fact, LumaFusion recommends video tutorials if you are a beginner to video-editing. Nevertheless, when it comes to feature-set, LumaFusion has one of the most advanced libraries of features that allows you to tell compelling video stories.

**Pros:**

* Uncluttered, intuitive, and customizable user interface
* Advanced and adjustable image stabilizer

* Supports all major video formats and more!

**Cons:**

* No android app available yet
* Not friendly for beginners
* No free version

**Price:** US$ 29.99, extra subscription for Storyblocks needed

### 3\. iMovie

Of course, how can we forget Apple’s native iMovie video editor? Yes, it lacks some bells and whistles, but it makes basic video editing a breeze. Suitable for beginners, iMovie's main aim is to provide ease of use in a clean and elegant interface. In all, you will not find advanced video-editing options. But when it comes to basic features like tripping, cutting, adding audio, subtitles, and transition effects — iMovie is second to no one in terms of usability.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform apps for all Apple devices
* Features like the Trailer timeline make the whole process seamless
* Simple and easy-to-use interface — suitable for beginners
* Good range of fun templates
* Multiple audio-editing options
* Completely free to use

**Cons:**

* For the sake of simplicity, iMovie excludes some critical functions like motion-tracking and more.
* No advanced options like editing 360-degree video editing

**Price:** Free

### 4\. KineMaster

**Price:**

* Premium Monthly — $7.99
* Premium Yearly — $35.99
* Legacy - Remove Watermark — $29.99
* Premium One-Time Purchase — $69.99

### 5\. Filmmaker Pro

Holding features like LUT effects, 4K capability, chroma key to add crazy 3D transitions, Filmmaker Pro is a viable option for any beginner learning how to edit videos.

**Pros:**

* Cross-platform support
* Multiple export options like YouTube
* Intuitive and simple interface

**Cons:**

* Subscription is compulsory if you want to remove the watermarks

**Price:**

* US$ 5.99 per month

## Part 2: Edit Video on Desktop with Filmora

## Part 3: FAQ

**Is the New M1 iPad Pro Good for Video Editing?**

Like most Apple products, the iPad Pro exterior hasn’t changed much compared to its predecessors, as the real magical upgrades are inside. The new M1 chip, the magnificent XDR display, 120Hz Refresh Rate, unbelievable Performance, Magic Keyboard, Thunderbolt 3, and USB 4 is enough to recognize the latest iPad Pro as the most powerful tablet ever made that can do everything that a Laptop can! Other hallmarks like the trackpad and magnetic slide — make it the perfect substitute for anyone looking to replace their laptop with an iPad Pro for video editing.

## Part4: Conclusion

Touch screens can be difficult to handle when performing precise operations like video-editing; that is why it is critical to use only the best video-editors on iPad.

Editor’s choice: Filmora. Reason: suitable for beginners and intuitive interface.

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

## Part 5: Extensive Reading: What are Sound Effects and Why are they Important?

Sound is the most important aspect of video editing that engages audiences, evokes emotional responses, and connects people to what they’re seeing. A melodious sound helps the video editors deliver information and creatively and define the tone of their narrative.

Sound effects (SFX) refer to audio clips or sounds that are not part of the recoded video. They are added to movies, documentaries, video games, and even reality shows to invoke the viewers’ emotions and increase their interest in the video.

Similarly, the addition of sound effects increases the production value and creates a complete audience experience. If you want to elevate your video dramatically and make it magnetic, have to balance sound effects, silence, and music in such a way that they support each visual and every cut. Although audio cannot fix slipshod editing or amateur camera work, it becomes more crucial than video quality while you are trying to deliver a specific message in your video.

Professional video editors and filmmakers consider sound effects crucial to their video quality. A clear, melodious, and well-balanced audio adds depth to the visuals, evokes more emotions than the picture, and paints the audio picture of a particular setting.

Even silence, a powerful tool of the audio arsenal, speaks louder than the picture itself. Hence, balancing audio by adding sound effects can make your video stimulating, captivating, and emotional.

That's why a good editing tool always stocks a great number of sound effects for users, like **Filmora**. Click to download and take a look at all the effects in Filmora![](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Conclusion**

Sound effects are external audio files added to the videos to make them look interesting and worth watching. A perfect balance of sound, music, and silence allows the filmmakers to define the tone of their narrative and deliver their message creatively.

You can create sound effects through self-recording or by downloading them from external resources. To add sound effects to your video, use professional video-editing software like Final Cut Pro or Filmora. Both these applications are user-friendly and possess a huge library of a variety of sound effects and music files. Besides, their advanced features allow you to naturally add sound effects without affecting the video quality.

Suppose you have recorded a cinematic video of a beach in the evening visualizing the sunset and a few birds flying in the sky. Everything looks perfect except the audio, which seems to be fluctuating and breaking at some points. How would you address this challenge?

The best solution to this problem is adding sound effects, which can make your video more interesting and adorable. Setting the frequency of audio with on-screen visuals will invoke the viewers’ emotions and attach them to the scene.

Read this article to learn how to add sound effects to your video with Final Cut Pro.

![SoundEffect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/SoundEffect.jpg)

## Part 1: What are Different Types of Sound Effects?

Sound effects have four major types:

1. **Ambiance SFX**

These sounds fill the screen space to create a virtual sense of an environment or location such as the clattering sound of dishes in a restaurant or the sound of engines on a highway.

1. **Foley SFX**

A mixture of live performance and digital sound editing, these sounds are produced by the artists of Foley studio to match their sounds to the on-screen visuals.

1. **Hard and Soft SFX**

Hard SFX synchronizes a visual to what’s happening in the picture while SFX indicates the location to the audience.

1. **Electronic SFX**

These sounds are generated by instruments that create electronic-sounding effects like electronic keyboards, synthesizers, or plug-ins.

## Part 2: How to Add Sound Effects in Final Cut Pro?

Cinematographic productions need well-balanced music and sound effects. Luckily, **Final Cut Pro comes with** built-in audio enhancement features and third-party Audio Units (AU) effects that allow users to add sound effects to their videos and manage all audio processing tasks.

You can add sound effects in your video with Final Cut Pro. Wonder how? Follow these steps:

**Step 1: Open Photos and Audio Sound Bar**

* In the top-left corner, there is a **Photos and Audio** Click on this button as shown in the figure below:
* Select the **Window** and **Go To** Either press Shift + Command + 1 or tap **Photos and Audio** from the dropdown menu

![sound-icon](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/sound-icon.jpg)

**Step 2: Select the Sound Category**

* Choose a sound category or app from the Photos and Audio sidebar
* A list will appear contacting the audio clips in that specific category as shown in the figure below:
* You can find multiple music and sound clips in the Sound Effects category. The list also contains various apps you use on your Mac such as GarageBand, Music, and Logic Pro, etc.

![fcpx_sound](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx_sound.jpg)

**Step 3: Select the Music or Sound to be added**

* Filter the items in the browser by using the pop-up menu. Go to **Music > Purchased** or select **Sound Effects >** **Final Cut Pro Sound Effects > Impacts & Crashes.**
* Preview your selected audio file by selecting it from the list and clicking the **Play**
* If you want to select multiple items, command-click each item individually.

**Step 4: Use the Selected Music or Audio**

* Drag your selected sound clip to the timeline or the sidebar
* Once the **Photos and Audio** sidebar has been replaced by the **Libraries** sidebar, you can add the selected audio or music files to an event. The **Photos and Audio** sidebar will reappear as you drag those files.
* Play the video to make sure sound effects have been successfully added

For enhanced playback experiences, all MP audio files are automatically transcoded to MOV audio files. However, you can also find the original MP3 files in the source media files section of Final Cut Pro. Besides, by adding mono audio clips to a stereo project, only the single mono audio will be plated in both left and right channels. You can view them in the stereo audio meters of your project.

Surely you don't want to see your sound effect missing in your footage, but that happens a lot in FCPX. Just in case, you may want to see this article: [Proven Ways to Get Missing Sound Effects Back in Final Cut Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Part 3: How to Improve Your Video with Sound Effects?

In addition to Final Cut Pro, you can also use advanced video-editing software like Wondershare Filmora to improve your video by adding special sound effects. Here’s how you can do this:

Add the original video to Filmora by clicking the **Import** button or directly dragging the file to the primary window

Tap **Sound** to open a box listing different sound effects. Select your favorite sound effect and drag it down to the soundtrack below the video clip. Now, move the sound icon and the playhead to set the beginning and ending points. Press the **Play** button to ensure the newly added sound effect sounds well.

![add-sound2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/add-sound2.jpg)

Once you’ve done the final review, tap the **Create** button and **Format** tab. Then, choose your preferred format and location where the file needs to be exported. You can also upload this video on YouTube or Facebook, play it on different iOS devices, or burn it to DVD.
