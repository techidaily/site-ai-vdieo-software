Adding **Final Cut Pro subtitles and captions** is a great thing to expand your audience base, and thus the trend of adding captions and subtitles is becoming relevant day by day. There is a whole process to add Final Cut Pro captions and subtitles, which we are going to discuss below.

Let's check if there is any difference between captions and subtitles used in FCPX. Even though both these texts tend to appear at the bottom of the video screen, they have different purposes.

As we all know, subtitles depict foreign languages other than the language shown in the actual video. So, they are used to appearing on-screen frequently as the speaker speaks.

On the other hand, the captions display every kind of audio information, including sound effects, music, and background noises [(see how to remove background noise in FCPX here)](https://filmora.wondershare.com/final-cut-pro/remove-background-noise.html). Every Caption represents that viewer hasn't any audio clues and thus displays them over the video.

## Part 1: How to Add Subtitles/Captions in Final Cut Pro X?

Before you study the steps required to add subtitles to Final Cut Pro, here are some quick facts about the format of captions supported by FCPX.

* **ITT (iTunes Timed Text)**

It is required to deliver the contents of Caption to the iTunes store.

* **CEA-608 (SCC)**

It is a standard caption format for web videos and broadcasts.

* **SRT (SubRip)**

It is a simple and popular format used in online videos.

### Steps to Add Subtitles or Captions in FCPX

**Step 1: Create Caption Roles**

You need first to create caption roles to start adding captions to the timeline. Go to **Modify** \> **Edit Roles** and then select **Captions**. Then, select CEA-608, choose your language, and hit the Apply button.

**Step 2: Add Captions**

Position the playhead to where you have to set the Caption in the timeline. You need to hit the **Edit** tab and then select **Captions** \> **Add Caption**.

Select the drop-down menu across the language and select **CEA-608**.

Now, you can add captions in the preview window or the **Captions Text** given alongside.

Also, you can adjust the duration of the Caption by dragging it in the timeline.

**Step 3: Export a Caption Role**

Press **Command + E** or go to **File** \> **Export** to open the **Export** preview window. Now, you can select the name and save your video in standard export options. Hit the **Roles** tab given at the top.

Then, click the small **Captions** icon to reveal the menu. Select the subtitles or captions to import alongside the **Burn in Captions** tab. Hit the **OK** button and proceed with export as usual.

Thus, similar steps are required even if you want to add subtitles.

If you're on Mac and want to make a personalized movie from a collection of pictures and videos, you need effective video editing software. **iMovie** might be your first choice since it's free and simple. But you may also want some other apps which can offer you **more features and controls**. Fortunately, there are many alternatives to iMovie in the market.

So, to help you make a movie on Mac easily and quickly, I will show you how to create a movie on Mac with detailed steps.

Movie creator: [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) has a user-friendly and intuitive interface as well as plentiful features. **This software enables you to create custom movies with pictures, music and effects.** You can then watch the movie on your Mac, share with friends or family members, post it on a social networking site or burn it to a DVD. Now check out the steps below to see how to make a movie with it.

## How to make a movie on Mac \[Step by Step tutorial\]

#### 1. Import video/photo/music files to the program

Install and run Filmora for Mac. Choose **"New Project"** to get started. Then click **"Import"** or directly drag and drop your video, photo or music files to the media panel.

You can also use a media browser to get files from your iTunes library, iMovie, etc.

TIPS

Recording video is also available in Filmora. You can either use a video capture device or the built-in iSight

![movie maker mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/import-media-file-mac.jpg)

For the detailed information about How to import media files to Filmora for Mac, check our [Import your media files guide here](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. Start making your movie

Now it's time to take your movie to the next level by adding personalizing and special touches, such as intro/credit, transitions and effects.

 **Intro/credit:**  just like you see in movie theaters and on DVDs, you may want to add an intro at the beginning of your movie that tells people a little bit about your movie and add credits at the end to tell the world who created and starred in it.

Filmora for Mac allows you to caption with more than **200 titles and text styles** with or without animation. To do this, just switch to the Intro/Credit tab and drag the effects to the place where you want it to appear. Then double click and go to “Title” to enter your words or change the Font, Size, and Color of the texts.
