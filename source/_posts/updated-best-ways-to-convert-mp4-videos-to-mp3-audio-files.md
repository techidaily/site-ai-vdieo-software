The MP4 file format is probably the most commonly used video file format today, as various video recording devices use it as the default video file format. The duration of a video and the resolution in which a video was captured determine its size, so the size of an MP4 file can vary between a couple of hundred of megabytes to a couple of gigabytes.

This one is a little more complicated — if you don't know how to find the direct URL link for Instagram Reels, but the process is actually much of the same, as we'll show you in the breakdown of the steps below:

**Step 1: Search for Audio**

The first step is to search for the audio that you're looking to download. For this, make sure that you select 'Audio' on the Search options!

![Instagram Search Options - Audio Selected](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-1.png)

**Step 2: Select Audio!**

Next, select the audio reel that you want to download!

![Instagram Search - Search Audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-to-download-instagram-mp3-2.png)

**Step 3: Share Option!**

Once you've arrived on the audio page of your chosen track, select the share settings at the top right corner of the screen (pointed out in the image below.)

**Step 4: Copy Link & Download!**

At the bottom of the screen, you should now find an option to copy the direct URL link of the audio that you've chosen (as shown in the image below!)

Now, as mentioned in the previous section, all you need to do is take that link to an **insta mp3 converter**! The best of which we'll be introducing in the next section.

### 03**Instasaved**

**Price**: FREE

With our next pick, we spice it up with an Instagram-specific tool, called Instasave that you can use to download pretty much any kind of Instagram content that you want. That, of course, includes allowing you to **convert MP3 Instagram** posts! Note, however, this is not as well-known as other options out there, so use it mindfully!

| Features                                                                                                                         | Limits                                                                     |

### 04**OffMP3**

**Price**: Free

Next on our list is OFFMP3\. It is, much like the other tools we've introduced thus far, an online video converter tool! This one, however, just like Intasaved, is a lot more obscure than the first two that we introduced. And thus, a little more limited.

| Features                                                                  | Limits                                                                    |

### 05**4ins**

**Price**: FREE

Despite the name, 4in's Instagram to MP4 converter does work for converting Instagram posts into MP3 files as well (as is shown in the image below). It's not the most advanced converter tool out there. But it does work, and it requires no download or installation.

| Features                                                                                                                 | Limits                                                                  |
