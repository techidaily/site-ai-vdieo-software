### 2\. Why is the animation used in education?

As we grow up, animation triggers the centers of the brain that work best for visual learning. When we insert a moral into a cartoon, it is also more often remembered because of the visuals. It is like the difference between seeing a film and reading a summary of the film.

Educational Animation Software is the tool we use to help create educational animations. It is playing more and more of a role in the teaching world, the deeper we go into the digital age.

### 4\. What makes a good educational video?

This exposition audits writing applicable to every one of these standards and proposes viable ways educators can utilize these standards when using video as an instructive device.

All three components together answer the question of how to make animated educational videos.

### 5\. Which animation software is best for beginners?

## **Part 1: The autosave mechanism of Final Cut Pro X and manual storage procedure**

Stepwise instructions to modify the autosave settings in the FCPX program

Step 1: Launch the FCPX app, press Ctrl+Q to open the ‘User Preferences’ window.

Step 2: In the ‘User Preferences’ screen, you can find a wide range of options to modify. Alter the levels of Undo, autosave vault attributes according to your needs, and save the changes. You can witness these parameters in the General section in the User Preference screen.

Use the User Preference window to make necessary changes according to your requirement. BY default, the Autosave Vault is enabled, and you can work on the projects without any hesitation. Additionally, you can modify the attributes like ‘Save a copy for every’, ‘ Keep at most’, and ‘Maximum of’ to personalize your projects.

![auto-save](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/auto-save.jpg)

When the FCP file is open, you need not worry about the saving procedure. The app triggers the autosave mechanism for regular intervals, and the changes will be up-to-date.
