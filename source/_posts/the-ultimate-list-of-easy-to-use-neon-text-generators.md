DVDs are not as nearly as popular as they were in the 2000s, simply because USB flash drives are much more durable than DVD discs. One of the easiest ways to back up the data stored on DVDs is to convert it to digital video file formats, like [MOV](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or [MP4](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

You cannot just copy and paste the data from a DVD or Blu-ray to a computer since you need file conversion software in order to [change the format of a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Read on if you are looking for a way to **convert a DVD to a digital video file format** because in this article we are going to take you through some of the **best DVD to digital format converters**.

## How to convert DVDs to Digital Video File Formats?

The process of [converting a video file](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is simple, and anyone can perform it in just a few minutes even if they have never done it before. However, converting DVDs to digital file formats without permission is punishable by the law, so you must make sure that you have the right to use the file you created freely. Let’s take a look at some of the best DVD to digital format converters.

### 1\. [Vudu](https://www.vudu.com/content/in%5Fhome%5Fdisc%5Fto%5Fdigital.html)

**Price:** $2 - $5 per conversion

**Compatibility:** Android, iOS

Having a source of entertainment in your pocket wherever you go can make dull long journeys much more fun. Vudu allows you to manage your film collection directly from your Smartphone and have access to all your DVD and Blu-ray discs at any moment.

![VUDU-convert](https://images.wondershare.com/videoconverter/player/movie-apps-ipad-vudu.jpg)

In order to start the conversion process, you just have to scan a disc’s barcode and the app will automatically convert it to a digital video file format. You can choose to convert a Blu-ray to HDX, DVD to SD or DVD to HDX, however, you will have to pay between $2 and $5 plus the tax for each file you convert with Vudu. Furthermore, the app features an impressive movie collection with more than 100,000 titles you can watch anytime and anywhere.

### 2\. [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/)

**Price:** Free

This open-source file converter can help you convert any DVD to a file format you choose effortlessly. PC users that have Windows 7 or later can install HandBrake for free, although the application only works on 64-bit versions of the OS.

You can choose from a variety of device presets that automatically adjust the conversion settings to a device on which the converted DVD video is going to be played. In addition, HandBrake lets you choose the output file format, set the preferred [framerate](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)or [apply video filters](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) such as [Denoise](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), Grayscale or Deinterlacing. Nonetheless, HandBrake can only convert DVDs to MP4 or MKV file formats, which can considerably limit your conversion options.
