## Measure and Modify Image Size

You might have noticed that earlier DVDs came with full screen or widescreen viewing choices. Moreover, when you choose the wrong option, it cuts off the movie parts, or the video gets surrounded by black padding.

So, below is the guide to find, calculate and adjust image ratio with a picture ratio calculator. Let's get started.
