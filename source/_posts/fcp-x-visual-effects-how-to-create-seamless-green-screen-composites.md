Chroma-key (also called "green screen") effects are a staple in video production. What [FCP X effect](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)does is allow you to make the background behind an actor transparent so you can place the actor into a different environment than a studio.

This is a basic tutorial about Apple Final Cut Pro X, professional video editing software. However, if video editing is new to you, consider [Wondershare Filmora for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). This is a powerful but easy-to-use tool for users just starting out. Download the free trial version below.

## Getting Started

First, the best thing you can do to improve the quality of your keys is to improve how you shoot them. Here are seven basic production rules:

* Actors should be at least 10 feet in front of the green screen. This avoids light from the background "spilling" around their body or shoulders.
* In general, don't cast shadows on the green screen. Be very careful shooting feet.
* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

## How to Create a Chroma-Key in easier ways?

Chroma-key, or green screen, is an essential part of every editor to make all kinds of effects. Is there any way to make this sophisticated procedure easier way? Yes, try Filmora.

In version 10.5 for Mac, Filmora added a new feature: AI portrait. It allows you to do a green screen effect with just one click.

By adopting AI portrait, you can add those stunning effects in simple steps: How to Remove or Change Video Background in One Step?

## Conclusion

The chroma-key filter in FCP X allows us to create some amazing effects. If you want to use green screen effects more easily, here is [Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you. You can appaly Chroma-Key effects with just a few click. Have fun playing with it.

* The green background should be as smooth as possible. Paint is always better than fabric; avoid wrinkles and folds.
* The green background should be lit smoothly, both from side to side and top to bottom. I try to have the green background display between 40-50% level on the waveform monitor.
* There is NO relationship between how the background is lit and how your actors are lit. This article will illustrate that.
* Light your background for smoothness. Light your actors for drama.
* Don't worry about having the green background fill the frame. It only needs to completely surround the edges of your actors. Garbage mattes are used to get rid of junk around the edges.

## Setting up the Key

![fx chroma 01](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-01.jpg)

The green screen image is always placed above the background. You can place either the green screen or background image into the Primary Storyline. I find it easier to put the background in the Primary Storyline, because it makes editing the green screen image easier. But this is purely personal choice.

**Step 1: Select the green screen clip**

From the **Effects Browser > Keying** category, double-click the **Keyer** effect, which applies it to the selected clip. (You can also drag the effect on top of the clip, if you forgot to select the green-screen clip first.)

![fx chroma 02](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-02.jpg)

Don't panic if your image looks weird – we will fix it.

![fx chroma 03](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-03.jpg)

Click the **Sample Color** icon. This allows fine-tuning the selection of the background color.

![fx chroma 04](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-04.jpg)

In the green-screen image, drag to select a representative section of the background. I try to get close to the face, but not so close that I accidentally select loose hair or skin.

Your key should look better immediately. Most of the time, you can probably stop here. But there are three other adjustments that can make your key look even better:

* Cleaning up the matte
* Edge adjustments
* Light wrap

![fx chroma 06](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-06.jpg)

Click the **Matte** button to display your key as a white foreground on a black background.

![fx chroma 07](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-07.jpg)

Your goal is the make the foreground solid white, which means opaque, and the background solid black, which means transparent. Adjust the **Fill Holes** and **Edge Distance** sliders until your key looks solid. (For REALLY bad keys, you'll need to also adjust Color Selection, mentioned below.)

![fx chroma 05](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-05.jpg)

If an edge is too pronounced, or needs help, click the **Edges** icon.

![fx chroma 09](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09.jpg)

**Step 2: Tweaks Video**

Then, click and drag a line from the foreground to the background in the Canvas. Drag the midpoint slider (where my cursor is) until the edge looks the best it can. Different video formats make this easy (ProRes), while others (HDV, avchd) make this much harder. Perfection is impossible – do the best you can.

![fx chroma 09a](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-09a.jpg)

Final Cut provides four additional tweaks at the bottom of the keyer filter:

* Color Selection
* Matte Tools
* Spill Suppression
* Light Wrap

The first three are designed to clean up poorly shot keys – read the FCP X Help files to learn how these work. (I used the Color Selection tools to clean up the very dark key I use an example later in this article.)

Light wrap, though, is aesthetic. What it does is blend colors from the background into the edges of the foreground, to make the entire key look more "organic," as if the foreground and background were actually in the same space.

This is a subtle effect, but very cool.

![fx chroma 10](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-10.jpg)

Twirl down Light Wrap and adjust the Amount slider and watch what happens. Drag the other sliders around and see what happens. The nice thing about this setting is that when it looks good to you, it is good. The amount of the effect is totally up to you. Remember, Light Wrap only affects the edges of the foreground and should be used subtly.

![fx chroma 11](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-11.jpg)

When you are done, you have a great looking key!

## Clean up the Image with a Garbage Mask

![fx chroma 12](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-12.jpg)

Sometimes, however, you don't have, ah, perhaps, the best green-screen image to work with. Here, for example, there are lighting instruments in the foreground, with a very inadequately lit green screen in the background. (Sigh… this is just pitiful.)

Once you pull the key – which is film-speak for creating a green-screen shot, as I described above – and get it looking as good as possible, there's one more step: adding a garbage matte to get rid of all the garbage surrounding your actors.

![fx chroma 13](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-13.jpg)

Once you get your key looking as good as you can – which in this case isn't all that good – drag the Mask effect (**Effects > Keying > Mask**) on top of the green-screen clip.

**NOTE**: The Mask effect should always be added after the Keying effect, so that the Mask is below the Keyer in the Inspector.

![fx chroma 14](https://images.wondershare.com/multimedia/fx-chroma-14.jpg)

Then, drag each of the four circles to create a shape such that your foreground image is contained inside it, and everything you want to exclude is outside. Here, for instance, we removed the light stand, the edge of the green background and the tearing at the top of the image. I've found this Mask effect works best when applied to a connected clip.

However, the big limitation of the Mask effect is that you only have four points to work with. That's where a free effect comes in, which allows you to create far more flexible shapes with it. It's written by Alex Gollner and is available on his website – alex4d.wordpress.com/fcpx/ – I recommend his effects highly.

With several video-sharing platforms and billions of videos on those platforms, it is very difficult and competitive to make your mark and have an identity. There are hundreds of categories of videos that you can find on the platforms like Youtube, Dailymotion, Vimeo, and more. Among all those categories, reaction videos are one of the most popular categories. It allows a person to review another person's opinion, view, or idea about any particular issue or instance. Most of the video-sharing platforms enable their users to make all kinds of reaction videos without any restriction. Having such a huge competition makes it hard to stand out and attract viewers.

Have you ever seen videos where the reactor has a transparent background instead of the rectangle box in the corner? They look nice and engaging, right? The process of making such videos will require so many materials such as a green screen, stand, and other materials to support it. It is difficult for everyone to afford all these and secondly, it is very difficult to carry from one place to another.

With Filmora X, you can create such transparent background reaction videos without such expensive material. Filmora has launched a new feature name AI Portrait that uses artificial intelligence to create amazing and cool effects. It uses the latest technology to separate the background and humans in the footage to help you remove the background with a single click. So, let's get started with the process of making stunning reaction videos with Filmora's AI Portrait.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png)

If you haven't purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on "Try It."

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5.png)

**Step 08:** To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8.png)

**Step 09:** In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.

The process of making such videos will require so many materials such as a green screen, stand, and other materials to support it. It is difficult for everyone to afford all these and secondly, it is very difficult to carry from one place to another.

With Filmora X, you can create such transparent background reaction videos without such expensive material. Filmora has launched a new feature name AI Portrait that uses artificial intelligence to create amazing and cool effects. It uses the latest technology to separate the background and humans in the footage to help you remove the background with a single click. So, let's get started with the process of making stunning reaction videos with Filmora's AI Portrait.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step1](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step1.png)

**Step 02:** Import the video that you want to react to and your reaction video. If you have not already recorded your reaction, then record it first using any camera or smartphone.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step2.png)

**Step 03:** Place both of these videos into the timeline. Make sure to place your reaction above.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step3.png)

**Step 04:** Select your reaction video on the timeline and go to the "Effects". Here you will find a new folder named "AI Portrait", open it. Here you will find multiple AI portrait effects.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step4.png)

**Step 05:** Our goal is to remove the background of the reaction. To do that, we will use Human Segmentation. Drag and drop Human Segmentation into the reaction video. If you haven't purchased this effect already, it will ask you to buy it to export the video. But you want to try it first, click on "Try It."

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step5.png)

**Step 06:** Once the effect is successfully applied to the video, its background will be removed automatically.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step6.png)

**Step 07:** Adjust the video by making it smaller and place it in the bottom left corner of the screen. Your reaction video is ready to be uploaded on video-sharing platforms.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step7.png)

**Step 08:** To make your video look cool and stunning, you can also add multiple other effects to your reaction. AI portrait allows you to add a border around the character to make it look more visible and separate it from another video. Go to the AI portrait and drag Human Border Effect and drop it into your reaction. It will create an outline around the character and make it look more visible.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step8.png)

**Step 09:** In some instances, you might need to change the position or size of your reaction. You can easily do that by applying the Keyframes to it. If you feel like changing the part of your reaction at some point in the video, go to that point in the timeline and click on the keyframe button above the timeline.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step9.png)

**Step 10:** Once you click on the keyframe, it will add a keyframe to the video. Now move forward into the timeline to a point and adjust your character's position by dragging it. Let's move it to the bottom right corner. It will add another keyframe to the video in the timeline. Now the character will change its position from the left corner to the right corner once it reaches that specific point in time.

![make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step10](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-reaction-video-ai-portrait-step10.png)

#### Conclusion

AI Portrait allows you to create wonderful effects using artificial intelligence. This is one of the best uses of AI to make stunning reaction videos. It will not only save you a lot of time but will also help you save a lot of money by helping you remove the background of your video without expensive materials such as a green screen and other materials related to it.
