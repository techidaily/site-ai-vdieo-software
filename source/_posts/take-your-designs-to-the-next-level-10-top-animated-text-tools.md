Another free video editing software that works as a good replacement for pinnacle studio for Mac is Lightworks. It's packed with many useful features, and although there is paid version, the free version has all the bells and whistles needed for beginners.

However, if you're working with 4K videos for YouTube or Vimeo—you need to get the paid version of Lightworks as this feature isn't available in the free version. The paid version costs $25 a month. The free version includes multi-cam support, high-precision video trimming, video exports at 720p, and support for most video formats.

With OpenShot's special effects engine, users can modify, reverse, slow up or slow down videos, and preview projects in real-time. Furthermore, other standard features of OpenShot include composition, image overlays, clip resizing, trimming, snapping, scaling, watermarks, video transitions, title templates, creating personalized SVG vector titles, desktop integration, adjusting fonts, colors, 3D animated titles, and more.
