It's official! Apple will now start making in-house processors for Macs based on ARM 64-bit architecture, proving to be faster and much more efficient than its previous models. With all that, there might be a problem. Any software that does not support the new Apple M1 chip may not be compatible with Apple devices. But Wondershare has taken care of that small inconvenience.

The good news is that all versions of Wondershare Filmora X that are above 10.1 will support ARM. We at Wondershare have conducted these internal tests on all Apple Mac devices such as the Macbook Air, Macbook Mini, and Macbook Pro.

The testers at Wondershare have found out that our state-of-the-art software is all set to be utilized on the new and improved M1 chip that will be used in the new Macbooks.

We have released our newest version of Filmora which is the 10.1 and that is just the beginning! We plan to upgrade our software and come out with innovations that will surely match every update that Apple comes up with using the latest ARM 64-bit architecture.

As Apple introduces technological innovations, Filmora will match that with its product and service upgrades to ensure a better video editing experience for its users.
