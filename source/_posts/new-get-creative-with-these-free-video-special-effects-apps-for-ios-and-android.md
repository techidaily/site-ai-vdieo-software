Previously we’ve talked about the [Best green screen editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) in which there’re 2 green screen software especially for Mac users: iMovie and Final Cut Pro.

If you’re an iMovie '09 or later user or you bought your Mac on or after October 20, 2010, iMovie is the first solution for you, if you’re looking for a free green screen software for Mac. Be sure to enable green screen function in iMovie! Check this tutorial about [How to Use iMovie Green Screen Effect.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Powerful and Easy green screen software for Mac - Wondershare Filmora

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Find more details about how to composite a green screen video in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)for Mac (Latest version 9) is not only a green screen software, but also an all-in-one powerful, fun and easy video editing software. It is a better solution for prosumers (amateurs that want to look professional). With hundreds of effects and filters built-in, you could finish any advanced video editing with limitless possibilities within minutes. Download it to get started with your project now, here’s the free trial version!

Compared with Final Cut Pro($299), Filmora as an advanced video editing software for Mac is pretty affordable ($79.99/perpetual license). But trust me, it’s worth every penny as a professional video editor and high-end movie production. What you need is just more practices.
