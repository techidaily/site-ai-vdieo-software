Besides enhancing the photos you take with your Smartphone or your DSLR camera, you can use [photo editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to produce images that don’t look realistic. Cartooning a photo is one out of many options nearly all desktop-based photo editors offer, although in most cases you will have to combine several effects in order to cartoon your pictures.

However, photo to cartoon software products require some previous photo editing experience since you will have to do much more than apply an effect to a photo in order to make a photo look like a cartoon. We’ve selected some of the **best photo to cartoon software** products that can help you create stunning cartoons from your photos.

If you need to cartoon your video, you can try Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). The newly released Filmora professional video editing software can allow you to turn videos into cartoons with ease. The processing of converting videos into cartoon style is easy, just import the videos into Filmora, and then add the Cartoon effect under Stylize. Adjust the cartoon settings and do some basic color corrections to perfect the cartoon result.

### 1\. Adobe Photoshop

**Price:** $20.99 per month as a single app

Adobe Photoshop is one of the best photo editing software ever created, which is why it is hardly surprising that it can help you to cartoon a photo. Photoshop’s rich selection of effects includes a number of effects you can use to turn a photo into a cartoon.

Effects such as Sketch, Ink Outlines, or Cutout can all be used during this process, and you can also combine several effects while turning a photo into a cartoon. Needless to say, inexperienced photo editors can find this task overwhelming, because it requires a lot of patience and excellent knowledge of the software’s features.

This process can be very slow, especially if the person you are outlining has long hair or wears a sweater that has a wrinkled sleeve.

### 10\. Adobe 2D Animation Software

**Price:** Free trial, $20.99 as a single app

What’s more, you’ll have to convert your photos into vector drawings before you can import them into Adobe 2D Animation Software and use them to make a cartoon. Once you arrange all the images in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the final video, you can proceed to use the lip-sync features, synchronize the sounds with the movements of your characters or utilize the Bone tool to make the movements more fluid. All animations you create can be exported and used in HTML5, Canvas, or WebGL while you can also export them as GIFs or MOV files.
