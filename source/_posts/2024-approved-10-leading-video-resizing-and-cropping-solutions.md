## Solved: Final Cut Pro X Keeps Crashing

# Solved: Final Cut Pro X Keeps Crashing

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/benjamin-arango-author.jpg)

##### Benjamin Arango

 Oct 26, 2023• Proven solutions

Apple launched an advanced video editing tool, **Final Cut Pro**, back in 1999 and it didn’t take very long to get popular and gain recognition among the photographers and videographers. Later in 2003, Final cut pro beats Final Cut Express, [click to learn why](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). One of the best features that help it stand out from the rest of the video editors is that it is supported by all Mac systems and has permitted Apple to make it fully enhanced in terms of efficiency and speed, enabling it to edit even 4K UND footage without any rendering issues.

Along with such exciting advantages, the video editing tool comes with several disadvantages too. It is complex to understand especially for beginners and most importantly it keeps crashing, corrupting the file even if it is saved properly on your Mac system, which can lead to your entire work being lost. Several Final Cut Pro X users complain that their work gets corrupted as the video editing tool keeps crashing after intervals.

If you can relate to this scenario, you will find this blog post helpful as we have listed some methods that can possibly fix the crashing problem and save your hours of video editing efforts. Keep reading to know the steps that can prevent your video editor from crashing.

## Why Does Final Cut Pro X Keep Crashing?

According to Final Cut Pro X users, the video editor is a reliable and solid program, but it can be really frustrating for them when it keeps crashing. If your Final Cut Pro X video editor and program tool also keep acting up, it can probably be because of the corrupted preferences file.

A corrupted preferences file occurs when you do not reset your preferences and settings in the first place. Not resetting the preferences can corrupt the file and end up crashing the video editing tool, damaging the whole video. All those who want to troubleshoot and require methods to fix the crashing issue should take a few steps to resolve the problem which leads us to our second section.

## What to Do if Final Cut Pro X Keeps Crashing on Your Mac System?

One of the major issues in Final Cut Pro X is the crashing problem on the Mac system. If you encounter this problem and learn to isolate, troubleshoot, and fix this issue following the below methods, you will likely resolve the crashing problem on your own. However, you should always ensure keeping a back-up of your Final Cut Pro X media, libraries, and applications as a whole in order to keep the data before following the below steps.

![fcpx-mac-store](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/images/final-cut-pro/fcpx-mac-store.png)

### Method 1: Resetting Final Cut Pro X Preferences and Settings

As mentioned above, resetting the preferences and settings can help in resolving the crashing issue. Resetting preferences will not affect your projects, libraries, or media. With resetting, we mean that you should change the custom preference settings to the default settings. Before you take the plunge to reset your preferences, you should choose Final Cut Pro over Preferences and note all the specific settings that you have to make.

Follow the below steps to reset the preferences in Final Cut Pro X:

**Step 1:** Quit working on Final Cut Pro.

**Step 2:** Hold down the option and command keys, then open the Final Cut Pro.

**Step 3:** Click on the delete preferences option.

**Step 4:** In the last step, recreate the issue that you were having during video editing. If the problem is resolved, you should open Final Cut Pro preferences and apply the custom settings again.

**Step 5:** And, it’s done!

This method will reset all your preferences to default settings and this way it will empty the list of the recent libraries and media. Though the entire libraries are not erased, you will be able to find them in the specified location when you first created them. But they will only be there if you have created a back-up of your data. That is why we mentioned in the beginning to create a back-up of your Final Cut Pro data in the first place.

With the help of fixing the Final Cut Pro X preferences, you will be able to fix a lot of your problems especially the crashing one. The preferences are deeply embedded into the program operation even if we cannot directly amend most of them.

### Method 2: Restart Your Mac

If you find that there is a major crashing problem, another way to fix the problem is to restart the computer and by resetting the Final Cut Pro-related system resources. Here are the steps that you should follow to restart your Mac system:

**Step 1:** Choose the Apple menu.

**Step 2:** Reopen the Final Cut Pro.

**Step 3:** Reproduce the issue and see if the problem still exists.

If your Final Cut Pro X acts up on your Mac system, you should try restarting the system following the aforementioned steps. In case, restarting doesn’t fix the issue, you should apply the first method.

Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.

### 8\. Frameographer

**Price:**  $4.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frameographer-stop-motion/id503347879)

**User Ratings:**  3.4

If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.

### 9\. Osnap! Pro

**Price:**  $4.99, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osnap-ultimate-time-lapse/id457402095)

**User Ratings:**  4.7

Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices. Besides offering presets that enable you to complete projects quickly, this app is also equipped with features you need to control camera settings manually. Osnap! Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.

### 10\. iStopMotion

**Price:**  $9.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/istopmotion-for-ipad/id484019696)

**User Ratings:**  3.7

This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.

**Conclusion**

Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier. Each app for iOS and Android devices we included in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need during the process of making a stop motion animation. Which of the top ten stop motion apps for iOS and Android devices are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.

The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p.

The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.

### 1\. Stop Motion Studio

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.cateater.stopmotionstudio&hl=en%5FUS), [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stop-motion-studio/id441651297)

**User Ratings:**  4.5 on App Store, 3.8 on Google Play

Apple Watch can be used as a remote shutter release on the iOS version of the app, and you can also pair it with all DSLR cameras that have WiFi. Even though installing Stop Motion Studio on an iPhone, iPad or an Android Smartphone won’t cost you anything, you must make in-app purchases if you want to export your projects in 4K resolution or import images into the app.

### 2\. Clayframes

**Price:**  $2.28

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://www.educationalappstore.com/app/clayframes-lite-stop-motion)

**User Ratings:**  4.0

Despite the fact that Clayframes wasn’t updated in years, it is still one of the best stop motion apps for Android Smartphones. You can either capture new footage or import the images you want to use in your stop motion video, and arrange them in any way you want. The app’s erase tool allows you to remove rigs and all other objects you don’t want to keep in the shot.

**Price:**  Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=tv.picpac)

**User Ratings:**  4.0

Inexperienced photographers who are still learning how to make stop motion animations should consider installing PicPac Stop Motion & Time Lapse on their Android phones. The features this app offers may not be the most powerful, but you can still use them to create a smooth stop motion animation. The app’s Timelapse-manual mode enables you to take a new photo each time you make a loud noise and you can also record voiceovers or create soundtracks for your videos with PicPac. The app lets you share all of your creations on YouTube, but only if you are signed in to your account. Furthermore, the free version of PicPac watermarks all your videos and it doesn’t allow you to export videos in resolutions larger than 360p. That’s why you must upgrade to the pro version of the app if you want to create stop motion animations with it on a constant basis.

### 4\. iMotion

**Price:**  Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/in/app/imotion/id421365625)

All projects you create with iMotion can be exported in 4K, 1080p or 720p resolutions, although shooting in 4K is only possible on newer versions of iPhones and iPads. The free version of iMotion offers only a limited range of options, and you must purchase the full version of the app if you want to use all the tools it has to offer

### 5.Stop Motion Maker

**Price:**  Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/stop-motion-maker/id669869003)

**User Ratings:**  4.0

Making a stop motion video with this app is a straightforward process that can be completed in just a few easy steps. After you launch the app and tap on the Create button, the device’s camera will open and you just have to press the camera button each time you want to make a new frame. Tap on the Done button once you complete the sequence of images, so you just have to preview the result before proceeding to export the video. The app doesn’t allow you to record voiceovers or create soundtracks, and you must use another video editing app for iOS devices if you want to edit a stop motion video further. It is worth noting that you must give Stop Motion Maker access to your phone’s camera and photo library in order for it to function properly.

### 6\. [Stop Motion Movie Creator](https://www.apkhere.com/app/com.mattel.MCSMMC)

**Price:**  Free

**Compatibility:**  Android

Stop Motion Movie Creator grants you access to the music and sound effects from the video game, which enables you to create perfect soundtracks for the videos you make with this app. The best part is that you don’t have to create Minecraft-inspired stop motion animations since the app enables you to make videos using clay figures or Lego bricks.

### 7\. Life Lapse Stop Motion Maker

**Price:**  Free, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/life-lapse-stop-motion-maker/id1281464378), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifelapse)

**User Ratings:**  4.8 on App Store, 3.6 on Google Play

Life Lapse is probably one of the best stop motion apps ever created because it offers all the tools you need to shoot and edit a stop motion animation. Focus, white balance and exposure lock, ghosted image overlay or interval timers are just a few among countless options you can use while shooting a stop motion video. Optionally, you can import photos and use the app’s video editing tools to adjust frame rates, apply visual effects or create soundtracks from royalty-free songs. Life Lapse grants you access to color correction tools, which enables you to set saturation, brightness, contrast or white balance values manually for each frame you include in the stop motion video you are making. You must upgrade to the app’s pro version if you want to record footage in 4K resolution, import audio files to your projects or export videos without a watermark.

### 8\. Frameographer

**Price:**  $4.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/frameographer-stop-motion/id503347879)

**User Ratings:**  3.4

If you are looking for a simple app that lets you take image sequences with ease, you shouldn’t look much further than Frameographer. You can choose if you want record stop motion videos with iPhone’s front or rear cameras in 1080p or 720p resolutions. Additionally, you can enable or disable a grid that helps you compose shots or lock the focus and exposure. Frameographer also features a low-light Boost mode, which enables you to make stop motion or time lapse videos under low light conditions. The app lets you add new frames to projects you already created so that you don’t have to complete all the work on a stop motion video at once. Frameographer lets you use songs from your iTunes music library, but the lack of video editing features makes this app a relatively poor choice for video content creators who want to edit their footage quickly before posting it on social media.

### 9\. Osnap! Pro

**Price:**  $4.99, offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/osnap-ultimate-time-lapse/id457402095)

**User Ratings:**  4.7

Photographers who like shooting time-lapses and stop motion videos with their iPhones can benefit from installing Osnap! Pro on their devices.

Pro lets you shoot in 4K or Full HD resolutions, and you can choose if you want to create a vertically or horizontally oriented video or set an aspect ratio that best fits your project. The app allows you to trigger the photo capture feature using loud sounds and even set reminders that notify you when you are supposed to take a new photo. However, if you want to import photos from your device, record voiceovers or transfer footage via WiFi you must make in-app purchases.

### 10\. iStopMotion

**Price:**  $9.99

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/istopmotion-for-ipad/id484019696)

**User Ratings:**  3.7

This app offers only a standard set of stop motion tools, such as onion skin or instant playback, which makes it largely overpriced as it fails to offer any of the advanced stop motion photography options. What’s more, you have to install an additional app if you want to snap photos remotely and you won’t have access to any photo editing options. Rearranging the frames you add to the timeline isn’t possible and the app doesn’t even have the undo option. The app offers audio recording features, which enables you to create voiceovers for your videos, and you can import audio files you would like to include in your soundtrack. Even so, iStopMotion is far from being a perfect stop motion app, as there are many better options you can find on App Store.

**Conclusion**

Recording and editing stop motion animations from Smartphones and tablets has never been easier. Each app for iOS and Android devices we included in this article grants you access to all the tools you’re going to need during the process of making a stop motion animation. Which of the top ten stop motion apps for iOS and Android devices are you going to choose? Leave a comment and let us know.
