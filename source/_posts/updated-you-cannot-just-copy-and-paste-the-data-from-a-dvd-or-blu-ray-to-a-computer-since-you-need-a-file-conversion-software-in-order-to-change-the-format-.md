**Price:** Free version available, pricing options start at $69

Furthermore, you won’t have access to 4K and  profiles and you will only get a free DVD Ripper account.

Both Full Trial and Paid versions of this DVD converter let you export multichannel audio files, but the free version limits the number of audio channels to just two. The [resolution of the output videos](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) cannot be higher than 480p regardless of the subscription model you choose, but you can purchase the Enlarger AI app separately and use it to upscale the videos up to 1080p.

### 6\. [WinX DVD Ripper Platinum](https://www.winxdvd.com/dvd-ripper-platinum/)

**Price:** $59.95

**Compatibility:** macOS, Windows
