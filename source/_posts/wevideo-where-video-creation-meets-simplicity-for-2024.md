## #3 Polish your WeVideo creation

 After that, drag and drop your contents in any order you want. This will help you to organize your contents. Then you edit the video as you like. For example, you can trim your video clips to focus on some key moments or and cut a long video into smaller ones. You can also add text, effects, music, and graphics to your videos. Or go to the _Theme_ tab to add some creative themes to your creation.

## #4 Publish your videos

 After finishing your creation, go to _Publish_ to upload your videos directly to YouTube, Google Drive, Facebook, and Twitter. You can even change the video resolution or set your content’s visibility by choosing options like “private or public”.

 Although WeVideo provides some basic video editing functions, there are many features present in desktop video editors that WeVideo doesn't offer, such as slow and fast motion and noise removal, to name a few.

You can apply different effects like filters, picture-in-picture, transitions and many more to get that professional look out of your videos in mere minutes.
