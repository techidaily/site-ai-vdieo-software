## How to Edit Nikon Video Files

#### 1\.  Import your Nikon Video Files

First, transfer the Nikon video files to your computer. Then drag and drop them to the primary window after launching this program. All the imported files will appear as thumbnails in the left pane. You can double click a clip to preview it in the right previewing window. When everything is ready, drag and drop the videos to the Timeline to polish them as you like.

You can click the **Import** menu first and then select **Import from a Camera or Phone** option which will enter the **Import from Device** window. You can import only videos or only images or all media files to Filmora. All the imported media will be saved under C:\\Users\\admin\\Documents\\Wondershare Filmora\\User Media\\Device Import by default. But you can always change the default path.
