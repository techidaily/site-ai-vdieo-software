## Part 1: The Use of L-Cuts and J-Cuts in Video Editing

Ordinary images, text, subtitles, and GIF doesn’t work anymore to get followers or likes on a video on YouTube channel or Instagram. Thus, video creators are tired of trying the same filters, transitions on the video editor tool. To create amazing videos like the ones played on your television and favorite movies, all you need is the split edit type techniques, a powerful editing tool used by professional editors. Although called professional, it isn’t difficult for a beginner if you know J-Cuts and L-Cuts.

They are nothing but the transition between the video and audio at different times and are entirely separate from wipes and fades. Such video editing technique helps in maintaining visual continuity. These super basic cuts are a combination of dialogue and imagery, thus keeping the video flow without a monotonous feeling.

When you look at the above interface, you will see the basic phenomenon behind the two split cuts. In L-Cuts, although the first video ends, the audio continues to clip two as well.

Then, **what is a J cut in Final Cut Pro**? It is ultimately reverse or opposite of L-Cuts. Yes, the second clip's audio starts a while before the scene of the first video ends.

## Part 2: Step-by-step Guide on Using L-Cuts and J-Cuts in Final Cut Pro X

L-Cuts are now in Final Cut Pro X.

**Note:** Here, the L-Cuts added video clip has no audio and has related well enough to the first video clip. If the second video has audio, it must be detached first, and then you should drag the edit point.

In the case of Final Cut Pro **J-Cuts**, the process is reverse, where you need to detach the audio of the preceding or following video clip and drag the first video to the right.

* To move the playhead to the next edit point: press “**Apostrophe (‘) or down arrow key**”.

3\. To choose the audio or the video edit point, you can do one of the following:

* Press “**Shift-Backslash (\\)**” to select both sides of the audio endpoint.
* Press “**Backslash (\\)**” to pick both sides of the video endpoint.

4\. Here is the actual process or the keyboard shortcut that helps accomplish final **cut pro-L-cuts** or **final cut pro-J-cuts** by nudging the edit points.
