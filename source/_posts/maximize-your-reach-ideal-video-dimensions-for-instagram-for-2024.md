#### Trim MKV quickly with touch bar

Spending time editing and trimming MKV files can be annoying, especially if you have to go through extended footage. You can quickly cut video from the touch bar if you have a MacBook pro. Resizing one video multiple times has never been easy, but you can do it quickly with the touch bar function.

Open the video preview by double-clicking on the video in the media archives file. Choose endpoint and source by clicking on the icon. Finally, cut the segment to resize the video and keep repeating the process until you are happy with the size.
