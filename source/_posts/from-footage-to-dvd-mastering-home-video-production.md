## Compress MPEG2 Videos with Free VirtualDub Software

# Download VirtualDub MPEG2 & Use to Compress MPEG2 Videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

VirtualDub is a free video capture/processing tool for Windows platforms (2000/XP/Vista/7). And VirtualDub MPEG-2 is a modified version of VirtualDub that supports MPEG-2 import originally. However, just as the author said "This software is obsolete and will no longer be updated. For MPEG-2 and WMV support in the latest VirtualDub, try my plugins (MPEG-2 plugin for VirtualDub 1.8.1 or above - by editor)".

## Download and Install VirtualDub MPEG-2

You could [download VirtualDub MPEG-2](http://www.videohelp.com/download/VirtualDub-MPEG224586%20.zip?r=LcPXQgGCmNps) here and extract files to a folder. Now you get a video processing software with MPEG-2 video import supported. To run VirtualDub MPEG-2, double click the VirtualDub.exe.

## How to Use VirtualDub MPEG-2 to Compress Large MPEG-2 Videos

VirtualDub-MPEG2 is designed to work with mpeg2 video, such as Digital TV shows, un-encrypted DVD files (\*.vob) and these video files are usually in big size. Now you can compress them using VirtualDub MPEG-2.

### Step 1: Set Up Video Compression

Open your MPEG-2 video file through File/Open video file..., then go to Video/Compression to bring up the following dialog.

![virtualdub mpeg2](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-video-compression.jpg)

As shown above, select the XVID MPEG-4 codec and click Configure button to make Xvid settings.

![virtualdub mepg2 tutorial](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/virtualdub-mpeg2-compress.jpg)

**Note**: If Compression is disable, switch to Full processing mode first in the Video menu.

### Step 2: Set Up Audio Compression

Audio compression setup is similar to video compression, go to Audio/Full processing mode, and again Audio/Compression to open the dialog, where MPEG Layer-3 is recommended.

### Step 3: Start Compressing

Now it's the time to start processing your video, here is how:

1. Go to the File Menu
2. Select Save as AVI...
3. Select where you want to save the AVI and name it.
4. Click Save.

## Conclusion

The VirtualDub MPEG-2 needs some time to compress your video. The larger the video file is, the longer. But VirtualDub MPEG2 is a fast video processing software. Take a cup of coffee and relax. Once finished, use your favorite video player to see the compressing result.

If you don't like VirtualDub MPEG-2 and would like to find some more powerful editors, you can try [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), which supports Windows and Mac OS with high compatibility of input and output formats. Wizard-style interface and intuitive design will help you to compress video or any other editing operation easily and smoothly. Try it today by downloading the free trial version below.

**Step 2**. Right-click on it and click on Adjust Audio.

![ajust audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/8.ajust-audio.jpg)

## Section 3. Advance Editing tips for Gopro Video on Filmora

If you want to add even more pizzazz to your videos, then why not look into other powerful features like motion tracking, color match, and audio ducking? They may sound complicated, but in reality, they’re easy to use.

#### 1\. Motion Tracking

his feature lets you track objects in your videos so that other objects can move along with them. If you have a video in which you want to make it look like you have wings and you’re flying, then you can align the movement of the wings with the movement of your body using the motion tracking feature. Here are the steps you need to take to track objects:

**Step 1**. Double-click the video in the timeline and then check the Motion Tracking box.

**Step 3**. Select the media that you want to move with the tracked object. Remember that this media already has to be in the timeline.

![start tracking](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/32.start-tracking.jpg)

**Step 4**. Adjust the size or position of whatever media you selected in the previous step.

#### 2\. Color Match

Wondershare video editor for Mac also lets you color correct multiple videos as a batch. If you have videos that have similar lighting and you want to change their colors quickly to make them consistent, then you should use color match. Here’s how you can use it:

![color match](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/34.color-match.jpg)

![done](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/34.done.jpg)

If you feel the colors don’t match, you can open the Comparison Preview and use the slider to adjust the colors.

#### 3\. Audio Ducking

If you want to temporarily reduce one audio track volume so that another is more audible, use audio ducking. You can use it in videos where you want to decrease the volume of music when someone starts speaking to hear them better. Here are the steps:

**Step 1**. Select the audio track you want to make more audible.

**Step 2**. Right-click on it and click on Adjust Audio.

![ajust audio](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmoraX/Guide-Mac/8.ajust-audio.jpg)
