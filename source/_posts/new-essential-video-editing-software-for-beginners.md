[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

**Step 1: Import a Vertical Video and Add It to the Timeline**

Use the above method to import the source vertical video to Filmora X and add it to the Timeline. However, it is important to choose the button under the **Keep Project Settings** label when the confirmation box appears, so you get some real estate because of the landscape mode to add the blur effect.

**Step 2: Add Background Blur**

Go to **Effects** and choose **Default** from the left pane, as explained earlier. Next, expand the **Filters** tree if not already expanded, click to select **Background Blur** from the list, from the box on the right, choose and drag your preferred blur effect, and place it on a separate layer in the Timeline above the video track.

**Conclusion**

If you want to have full control over the post-production process, having an efficient desktop program like Wondershare Filmora X would be something you might be looking for. On the other hand, if you are not a professional editor or are not much into editing and prefer playing around with the tools for personal use, going for a decent web portal to **blur video online** is your best bet.
