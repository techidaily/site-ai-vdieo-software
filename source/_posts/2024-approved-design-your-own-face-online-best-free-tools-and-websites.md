Considering the above scenarios and many others that may come up over time, the following list some of the best free online face generators to create fake faces.

### 2\. Generated Photos: Anonymizer

**Website**: <https://generated.photos/anonymizer>

Anonymizer is another section from the Generated Photos portal that allows you to upload your image. Then it uses AI technology to generate similar virtual faces that you can download and use wherever needed.

However, sometimes the pictures that the website creates may not resemble your face as closely as you expect them to be, but that’s OK. Isn’t it? The main idea is to keep your privacy intact, and that’s what Generated Photos: Anonymizer does.

You can learn how to use this section by following the instructions given below:

* Use the URL given above to get to the Anonymizer’s web page and then click **Upload photo;**

### 3\. Generated Photos Face Generator

Website: [](https://generated.photos/face-generator)<https://generated.photos/face-generator>

Massless allows you to use its tools to sketch a portrait, and then it uses AI technology to generate a virtual face out of your drawing.

With Massless, you can explore your creativity to the full and draw beautiful faces to use them as your avatar.

You can follow the procedure given below to use Massless to draw virtual faces:

You can generate these virtual faces using any of the free online face generator websites, some of which even allow you to define the shape of a face quite minutely. Because the generated faces are not of any real human, they can be used as your avatar without any risk.
