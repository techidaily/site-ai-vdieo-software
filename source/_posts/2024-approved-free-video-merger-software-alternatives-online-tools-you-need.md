## The Best Free Online Video Mergers in 2022

The maximum file size a platform lets you upload or the number of supported file formats are among the most important factors you will have to consider before you choose an online video merger. In addition, the platform’s processing ability as well as the export options can have a significant impact on the quality of the video you’ll be able to produce. Here are the five best online video mergers you can use to create your social media videos in 2022.

#### 1. [Merge Video](https://mergevideo.online/)

This video editing platform allows you to do much more than just arrange and merge video clips, because it offers tools that enable you to resize, crop or rotate videos, adjust the colors in the footage you upload to the platform or cut and merge audio files. The process of combining multiple clips with this online tool can be completed in three simple steps, as you just have to upload the files you want to edit either from a hard drive or the cloud, rearrange them by dragging and dropping each video clip to a specific location on the timeline and choosing the format in which the file is going to be exported. You can opt to save the final cut of your video to your computer or to store it on Google Drive or Dropbox.

#### 3. [Aconvert](https://www.aconvert.com/video/merge/)

Even though this website is mostly dedicated to the conversion of different types of files, you can also use it to merge, cut, crop or rotate video files. Aconvert supports nearly all commonly used video file formats, so you can upload and merge mp4, flv, mov or avi files among numerous others. The maximum size of a video clip you can upload to this platform can’t exceed 1GB and you need to make sure that all files you want to merge have the same frame rate and format. Once you click the Submit button, you won’t be able to rearrange your video files, which is why you have to upload video clips in the exact same order in which you want them to appear in the output video. After the merging process is completed, you will be able to save the result on Dropbox, Google Drive or your Smartphone via a QR code.

#### 4. [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/maker/editor)

The wide range of video editing tools that the Kapwing offers makes it one of the best online video editors. You can use Kapwing to make video montages, crop videos, rotate them or perform any other basic video editing action without even having an account on the platform. In order to start merging the video clips you just have to select the Video Maker option, upload video files from an online source or from your computer and arrange them in any way you want. The platform also lets you choose the aspect ratio of the output video which enables you to create vertical or square videos effortlessly. Simply click on the Create! button when you are ready to export the video, and wait for the new file to be generated. Afterward, you can proceed to download the video to your computer or save it to your iPhone, but keep in mind that all videos you create with the free version of Kapwing are going to be watermarked.

#### 5. [Cellsea](http://www.cellsea.com/free-online-video-editor)

Cellsea is a platform where you can create your own ringtones, edit photos or merge videos for free. Its video editing tools enable you to cut, trim or resize videos, which makes it quite useful in case you want to polish your video before sharing it on social media.

When done, you can choose the output format of the video file and save it as mov, mp4, flv 3gp or avi file. The platform lets you download the results to your computer or you can choose to send them to your phone.

#### 6. [FlexClip](https://www.flexclip.com/features/video-merger.html)

Before you can start piecing together your video clips with this online video editing tool, you must first create an account or use your Google and Facebook accounts to sign in. You can then create a new project and once the editing window loads you can start adding video clips to the storyboard. Besides enabling you to upload videos from your computer, FlexClip also offers a rich selection of stock footage you can use in your projects, but you must keep in mind that the platform won’t let you upload videos that are longer than one minute. You can change the position of the video clip by dragging it to a new location in the storyboard and you can also use FlexClip’s music library to add sound to your video.

## Accelerate Your Videos: Top Tools for Windows and Mac

The volume of video information submitted to the Internet each day is mind-boggling, with individuals all over the world producing dozens of hours of film each day. Consequently, to achieve lots of views, comments, or likes on your social media videos, they must stand out in an ocean of content.

Slowing down or speeding up the film is a basic but powerful video editing technique that may make the stuff you post online more fascinating to watch. Continue reading to learn more about the Best Video Speed Changers for Windows and Mac in this article.

## Top 7 Best Video Speed Changers for Windows and Mac \[Free and Paid\]

Sharing raw videos you shoot with your smartphone with your fans and followers may not always provide the desired results. Slowing down the playback speed may make a scene more exciting or emphasize a crucial point in your film, while raising the playback speed of a video is an excellent choice for creating magnificent time-lapses.

Let's look at a few of the **best video speed changer software** for Windows and Mac for fast and slow-motion video editing.

### 1. [Windows 10 Photos App](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/microsoft-photos/9wzdncrfjbh4)

**Supported OS:** Windows

**Pricing:** Free to Use

Windows 10 comes with Microsoft Photos, a free picture viewer and editor that allows you to edit and improve photos while organizing and editing movies. Microsoft Photos has a touch-friendly interface and delivers excellent image editing and additions. Besides the basics, you get to change the speed of your video comfortably, accessing the in-built features with the lossless video quality.

To slow down or speed up a video clip in the storyboard, go to the "Storyboard" section and choose the video clip you want to slow down or accelerate. From the toolbar, choose the Speed button to accelerate. The speed of the clip may be adjusted by sliding the slider. Once you have completed the instructions, the video will begin to play at the speed that you specified.

![change video speed windows 10 photos app](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-video-speed-windows-10-photos-app.jpg)

The speed is set to 50% by default when you choose **Slow**, but you may change it by clicking any of the speed buttons. Accelerate the chosen segment of the video: Select Fast from the Speed pop-up option.

The speed is set at twice the standard pace (2x) by default when you choose **Fast**, but you may change it by clicking any of the speed buttons. To choose the speed, select Slow or Fast from the Speed pop-up menu and click a speed button. A slowed-down clip gets longer in the timeline, whereas a sped-up clip becomes shorter.
