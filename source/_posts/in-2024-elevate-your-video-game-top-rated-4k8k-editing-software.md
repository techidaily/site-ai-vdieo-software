* Unlimited layers

**Cons**

* It sometimes lags, which is inconvenient

## 2\. Shotcut

However, because Shotcut was created for Linux, many users may find the UI a little strange. Regardless, it's still a fantastic editor.

The premium edition of Lightworks charges $23.99 monthly, $239.99 annually, or $389.99 for a lifetime membership for a single user.

* Offers smooth service

**Cons**

* **Does OpenShot have a watermark?**

Openshot is a free, open-source video editing program with no watermark. As a result, although being a completely free tool, it's doesn't advertise its brand on your final video. Even though the marketplace is filled with open video editing tools, most of them leave a big watermark on your movie project.

## Conclusion

All of the [video editors](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) on this shortlist offer fantastic features and are completely free to use. They all have advantages and disadvantages, and you must choose depending on your requirements and usage.
