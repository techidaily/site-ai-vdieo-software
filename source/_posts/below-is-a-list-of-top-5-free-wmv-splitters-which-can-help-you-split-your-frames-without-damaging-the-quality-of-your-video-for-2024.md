## Mac Video Editing Made Easy with MKVtoolnix Software

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

MKVtoolnix is a very useful application that enables you to create, alter, split, join, and inspect MKV files. And thank goodness that it’s also available for Mac OS X. But to be frank, its interface comes on rather a difficult side and maybe too complex for novice users to interpret.

Then is there any good program similar to MKVtoolnix but comes more intuitive interface? Absolutely.

## Bonus! Remove watermark from your videos

Removing a watermark isn’t bad, especially when you put in a lot of effort to create and edit the video. Watermarking means that the person using or handling the video is not the rightful owner; this is possible with the help of tags or logos. Luckily, there are simple ways to help remove watermarks from any video. However, some of this software is easy to use; you to edit the video file before uploading it to YouTube or any platform of your choice. Below are two simple steps to remove a watermark from a video:

### 1\. Remove Watermark with the Crop tool

This method will entirely remove the watermark from your movie, but it will also crop out a portion of the video that contains the watermark. It might not work well with all video options, so you might lose some vital parts of the video frame. However, you can use Wondershare Filmora software to crop out the edges containing the watermark.

By this, import your video, right-click on the timeline, zoom the video and click on “crop” to manually trim the edges to your chosen size or use the automatic option to select a ratio. Now adjust the edges of the cropping box to remove the watermark. You’ve successfully erased a watermark from your movie by clicking OK to apply the cropping effect.

However, one of the setbacks is that you will have to cut out some parts of the video, and it does not work if the watermark is in any other position other than the corners.

### 2\. Apowersoft Website

Apowersoft is a web-based platform that allows you to remove watermark from video clips and images in very few steps. Other features available on the website include file compressor, Movie edition, video producer, and many more. However, below is a guide on using Apowersoft to remove watermarks from your video.

* Go to apowersoft.com in your browser. Then click on “Products & Solution” to choose from the Video Editor tab of the Online section.
* To remove the watermark, search and click on it.
* You can now upload the video to the website. After that, click the preview button to see a video preview, and then click the Add Box button to select a watermark for the video.
* Click on the “Erase button” to crop out the watermark section.
* Finally, download it to your PC.

## Conclusion

● Finding a video trimmer without a watermark can be difficult, and the truth is, having watermarks on your video makes it unprofessional. Though it might be for fun or personal use, why leave the watermarks when you can trim them off with a few clicks.
