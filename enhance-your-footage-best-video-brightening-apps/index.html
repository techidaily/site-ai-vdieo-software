<p>Brightening an iPhone video can help you see the activity on-screen and make it more appealing if you share it on social media or post it to a website.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Move your fingers upward on the iPhone screen to brighten the scene when you begin filming. This may be done at any moment while the video is being recorded.</p>

It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.</p>
<p>Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.</p>

<p>Boring and unexciting videos may turn off your mode. You need something special or wonderful that could turn you on and make your memories worth watching.</p>
<p>To let users give a new look to their pictures and videos, Apple Inc. released its first video editing software Final Cut Express in 2003. Over the next few years, various improvements were made in its updated versions.</p>

<p>However, after multiple inconveniences, Apple Inc. discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 and launched its new version Final Cut Pro with advanced video editing features. Final Cut Pro was customized for video editing professionals with advanced knowledge of video editing. It is available for just $299.99 with 90 days free trial.</p>
<p>Some alternatives to Final Cut Express are also available in the market such as Final Cut Pro of crouse, iMovie, a low-end alternative, and Filmora, popular among beginners and pros. Let’s look at these tools individually in this article.</p>

It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.</p>
<p>Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.</p>
<p>It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.</p>
<p>As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Final-Cut-Express-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Final-Cut-Express-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?"></a>Part 1: What is Final Cut Express?</h2><p>Final Cut Express was a video editing software designed by Apple Inc. for advanced editing of digital and HD videos. It was a consumer version of Final Cut Pro liked by professional photographers, due to its better capabilities than iMovie.</p>
<p>Final Cut Express used to have many features like two-way color correction, dynamic RT, Chroma key, 99 audio tracks, split-screen, and picture-in-picture effects, motion path keyframing, 23 compositing modes, and opacity keyframing.</p>
<p>It also allowed the users to keyframe the filters and perform slide and blade edits. Eight years after its release, Apple discontinued Final Cut Express in 2011 in favor of Final Cut Pro X.</p>

<p>You might be wondering what prompted Apple to do this. Well, the primary cause of the discontinuation of Final Cut Express was that Apple Inc. wanted to launch an advanced video editing software Final Cut Pro.</p>
<p>Besides, despite several attempts to improve the software’s performance, Final Cut Express kept on causing multiple inconveniences. The company eventually decided to discontinue Final Cut Express and introduce a new product to meet the ever-evolving needs of its customers.</p>
<p>As Final Cut Express withdrawal from the stage, many other editors still update to this day. For example, Filmora, an editor trusted by many beginners and pros, updates every month. Click download to try it for free!</p>

<h3 id="Ease-of-use-and-interface"><a href="#Ease-of-use-and-interface" class="headerlink" title="Ease of use and interface"></a><strong>Ease of use and interface</strong></h3><p>With VideoPad’s easy-to-use interface and well-organized conventions, movie makers of any skill level can become familiar with its basics in no time at all. You will become fluent in no time at all in opening and closing windows, stringing clips together, and adding narration, transitions, and text to create a powerful visual presentation. Adding video, audio, and still, photo assets to the files pane will put them on the timeline and allow you to assemble your story.</p>
<p>Videos and still images are organized into bins by the app, ensuring they don’t get confused on the timeline, which speeds up the workflow, especially for newcomers.</p>
<p>The app uses menus and can be dragged and dropped, so a single objective can be accomplished in different ways. You can control all functions from within the application frame, or dockable panels can be used to get a closer look at what needs to be done. A permanent reorganization of the workspace would be appreciated.</p>
<h3 id="Videopad-Video-Editing-Features"><a href="#Videopad-Video-Editing-Features" class="headerlink" title="Videopad Video Editing Features"></a><strong>Videopad Video Editing Features</strong></h3><p>VideoPad is the perfect balance between too much and not enough. Although there are not many options, it offers a reasonable selection of transitions for moving between clips and images, as well as a selection of filters to give them a unique look. In addition to editing 360-degree video, video stabilization is another helpful feature.</p>
<p>Each filter can be previewed with a click before applying it, and You can combine several to create a custom effect or template for reuse. You can also adjust their length via menus.</p>
<p>A video can be enhanced with transitions, visual effects, overlays, and text using VideoPad. Also included are some basic audio tools and a library of sound effects and atmospheric background music. There are a number of features that allow you to optimize videos, including color correction, adding digital images, adding subtitles, and adjusting the speed of playback. With its video stabilization feature, you can reduce camera shake, and the high-end version supports special effect plugins, but only for Windows.</p>
<h3 id="Videopad-Audio-Editing-Features"><a href="#Videopad-Audio-Editing-Features" class="headerlink" title="Videopad Audio Editing Features"></a><strong>Videopad Audio Editing Features</strong></h3><p>VideoPad offers a limited set of audio tools, but it does allow you to mix multiple audio tracks, music, and narration to create a movie soundtrack. A video clip’s audio can be faded, mixed, and adjusted for volume, but if you want to go further, you’ll need an external mixer or editor. From VideoPad’s main menu, you can download NCH’s own WavePad.</p>
<p>While the text-to-speech features always sounded false, you can record narration directly within the program. There is a great idea in having voice recognition for subtitles, which is only available on the Windows version. However, the implementation falls short of expectations. Although the video was clearly spoken in a quiet environment, it automatically failed to translate into subtitles.</p>
<h3 id="Videopad-Content-Sharing-features"><a href="#Videopad-Content-Sharing-features" class="headerlink" title="Videopad Content Sharing features"></a><strong>Videopad Content Sharing features</strong></h3><p>Video creators who publish to YouTube or other social media platforms can use the software because it allows them to share videos directly to platforms such as Dropbox, Flickr, Google Drive, and Vimeo.

<h3 id="7-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3"><a href="#7-Final-Cut-Pro-X-3" class="headerlink" title="7. Final Cut Pro X"></a>7. Final Cut Pro X</h3><p>Available only for Mac computers at the time of this writing, Final Cut Pro X or FCPX gives tough competition to Adobe Premiere Pro. Since Apple devices are famous for their speedy processing, professionals any day prefer FCPX over Adobe Premiere Pro if they own a Mac PC running macOS.</p>
<p>You can use FCPX as <strong>split screen video maker</strong> by following the steps given below:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Place Footages in the Timeline</strong></p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, add the clips on top of each other on separate tracks in the Timeline of FCPX.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Position and Crop</strong></p>
<p>Select the first clip in the Timeline, from the <strong>Transform</strong> section of the <strong>Video Inspector</strong> pane in the right, use the <strong>Position</strong> slider to move the clip to your preferred side of the screen, and use the sliders from the <strong>Crop</strong> section to crop the footage to adjust the portion of interest. Repeat the process for the other video tracks as well to get your desired split screen effect in Final Cut Pro X.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Offers quick and easy way to add split screen effect</li>
<li>Allows practically unlimited number of videos to be used for split screen</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Doesn’t have any particular preset for split screen effect</li>

<h2 id="Best-Free-Online-Split-Screen-Video-Editors-3"><a href="#Best-Free-Online-Split-Screen-Video-Editors-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Free Online Split Screen Video Editors"></a>Best Free Online Split Screen Video Editors</h2><p>Apart from the desktop programs discussed above, there are a couple of web tools that can be used as <strong>split screen video maker online free</strong>. Two of the most used ones are introduced below:</p>
<h3 id="1-Kapwing-Collage-Maker-3"><a href="#1-Kapwing-Collage-Maker-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Kapwing Collage Maker"></a>1. Kapwing Collage Maker</h3><p>Although Kapwing offers several other online tools like video resizer, meme generator, slideshow maker, etc., the solution that can be considered <strong>split screen video editor</strong> is Kapwing Collage Maker. This web app allows you to select a template to get started, and the rest of the process is simple.</p>
<p>The following steps explain how to create a split screen video with Kapwing:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Add Clips to Preset</strong></p>
<p>Go to the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.kapwing.com/collage" >https://www.kapwing.com/collage <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> link, click to select your preferred split screen preset, click <strong>REPLACE</strong> on one of the segments of the split screen on the next page, and select and upload the first video. Next, click <strong>REPLACE</strong> on the other segment(s), and select and upload the other videos as well.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Reposition and Publish</strong></p>
<p>Click and drag each of the added clips to reposition them on the screen, use the other tools to crop and adjust the videos as needed, and click <strong>Publish</strong> from the top-right corner. <strong>Note:</strong> Optionally you can click <strong>Timeline</strong> from the top of the preview window, adjust the timings and other settings as needed on the next page, and click <strong>Done</strong>. After this, you can go ahead and hit <strong>Publish</strong> to create the split screen effect out of the uploaded videos.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Free to use</li>
<li>Allows as many as 4 videos to create split screen effect</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Requires you to register and sign in to remove the watermark from the output file</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="2-WeVideo-3"><a href="#2-WeVideo-3" class="headerlink" title="2. WeVideo"></a>2. WeVideo</h3><p>Yet another <strong>split screen video maker online free</strong> solution, WeVideo offers almost desktop program-like experience while creating split screen effects. Even though all the subscription plans that the vendor offers are chargeable, the <strong>Education</strong> plan can be tried for 30 days for free, post which the teachers are required to pay to continue using the web tool.</p>
<p>The following steps explain how to get split screen effect with WeVideo:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1: Import Videos</strong></p>
<p>Visit <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.wevideo.com/" >https://www.wevideo.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and on the main window, click <strong>Video</strong> from under the <strong>Create a new</strong> section at the top, select a layout on the <strong>Let’s get started</strong> box, and click <strong>START EDITING</strong> from the bottom right corner. Next, click <strong>ADD</strong> in the <strong>My media</strong> window in the upper-left section, click <strong>BROWSE TO SELECT</strong> on the <strong>Import media</strong> box, and add the videos you want to use in the split screen effect.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2: Add Clips to Timeline</strong></p>
<p>As explained earlier, drag the videos from the <strong>My media</strong> pane and drop them in the Timeline. Make sure to place every video in its separate layer, and that all the layers are on top of each other.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3: Create Split Screen Effect</strong></p>
<p>Select any clip in the Timeline, and click the <strong>Open clip editor</strong> icon from the upper-left area of the track. On the next page, use the <strong>Scale</strong> slider to reduce the size of the selected clip, and from the preview window in the right, drag to reposition the video to your preferred location on the screen. Click <strong>SAVE CHANGES</strong> from the bottom of the left pane to confirm the settings. Repeat the process for the second clip in the Timeline to resize and reposition it on the screen. Click <strong>FINISH</strong> from the upper-right corner, on the next box, enter a name for the video in the available field, click <strong>SET</strong>, choose your preferred settings on the next page, and click <strong>EXPORT</strong> from the bottom-right corner to produce the split screen video.</p>
<p><strong>Pros</strong></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>Cons</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Paid subscription is needed to remove watermark from the outputs</li>

<h3 id="FAQs-About-Split-Screen-Video-Editors-3"><a href="#FAQs-About-Split-Screen-Video-Editors-3" class="headerlink" title="FAQs About Split Screen Video Editors"></a>FAQs About Split Screen Video Editors</h3><h4 id="Why-you-should-use-split-screen-effect-in-video-3"><a href="#Why-you-should-use-split-screen-effect-in-video-3" class="headerlink" title="Why you should use split screen effect in video?"></a>Why you should use split screen effect in video?</h4><p>There are a couple of reasons you may want to use split screen effect in your video. Some of the most common uses include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Showing multiple actions by the same or different characters at the same time, without changing the screen</li>
<li>Comparing multiple objects or picture quality. This can be done only when the entities in question are placed side-by-side</li>
<li>Making your video look more professional</li>
<li>Showing different effects on the same screen</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="Can-I-create-a-split-screen-video-with-Windows-Movie-Maker-or-Windows-10-Photos-app-3"><a href="#Can-I-create-a-split-screen-video-with-Windows-Movie-Maker-or-Windows-10-Photos-app-3" class="headerlink" title="Can I create a split screen video with Windows Movie Maker or Windows 10 Photos app?"></a>Can I create a split screen video with Windows Movie Maker or Windows 10 Photos app?</h4><p>No, you cannot. Although these tools enable you to resize the videos, since they don’t allow multi-tracked Timelines, no video clips can be placed one above the other which is an essential part for any <strong>split screen video maker</strong> to create the effect. However, as discussed above, there are several post-production tools, offline and online, that allow you to make split screen videos easily and without any cost.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p><a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/"><strong>Split screen video editor</strong></a> tools are both paid and free. Regardless of the program you use to create the effect, the output files always look more professional and informative. Furthermore, things become way simpler if the <strong>split screen video maker</strong> has simple UI, is less resource intensive, and is easy to use as it is the case with Wondershare Filmora.</p>
