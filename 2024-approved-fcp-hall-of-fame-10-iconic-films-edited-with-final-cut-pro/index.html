<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage.

                ></p>
<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>1. The Social Network (2010)</p>
<p>Based on the rise of the phenomenon that we now know as Facebook, The Social Network starred Jesse Eisenberg, Andrew Garfield and Justin Timberlake. The movie performed well at the box office and was also positively received by movie critics.</p>
<p>The film won an Academy Award for Best Editing, collected by Kirk Baxter and Angus Wall. They used Final Cut Pro to edit the film, and one of the things they really like about the software is the ability to do multiple timelines. Final Cut Pro was also used in this movie to enable face replacement in a number of scenes. Two of the key characters in the movie are twins, and so the scenes were filmed with actors (who weren’t twins) and then the editing software was used to create the illusion that they were twins. Digital matte paintings was another feature of this movie that relied on the functionality of Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>2. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (2011)</p>
<p>This was the US adaptation of the earlier Swedish film of the same name - based on the novel by Stieg Larsson. Starring Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara, the story is a crime thriller trying to uncover the secrets surrounding the disappearance of a young girl from a wealthy family.</p>
<p>One of the challenges with this movie was that there were a lot of invisible effects throughout the film. Final Cut Pro was used to achieve the shot stabilization and the visual enhancements - everything from matte painting to creating seasonal elements such as snow.</p>

<p>3. John Carter (2011)</p>
<p>A science fiction adventure, this film performed so badly at the box office that it caused major financial problems for its studio Disney.</p>
<p>The editing of the John Carter movie was a particular challenge as a lot of the action was shot twice during the troubled production. The editor Eric Zumbrunnen used Final Cut Pro to piece the various elements together. With a huge range of CGI and creature effects to deal with, the editing process on this movie was extremely complex. Final Cut Pro was used to create a lot of the background detail need to bring the green screen scenes to life.</p>

<p>4. 500 Days of Summer (2009)</p>
<p>This was a cute, quirky romantic comedy starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Deschanel.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Alan Edward Bell in DVCPro HD format on Final Cut Pro. Because the storyline of the movie unfolds in a non-linear timeline, the workflow feature of Final Cut Pro made it easier to manage the sequencing of the different scenes. There were also 250 invisible effects which were created using Final Cut Pro’s editing features.</p>

<p>5. X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009)</p>
<p>Continuing the X-Men franchise, this installment traces Wolverine’s childhood and the relationship with his brother. It didn’t really appeal to X-Men fans or movie critics.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Nicolas De Toth and Megan Gill. There were a number of continuity glitches identified during the production of this movie but De Toth and Gill used Final Pro Cut to keep a consistent flow to the narrative. What is interesting about the editing on this movie is that all the cutting of the scenes required was done on Final Cut Pro 5, taking advantage of the software’s HD abilities and also the multi-clip features.</p>

<p>6. Burn After Reading (2008)</p>
<p>A black comedy from the talented brothers Joel and Ethan Coen, they wrote, produced, edited, and directed the movie.</p>
<p>The Coen brothers used Final Cut Pro on this movie because it was simple and easy to use - they were blocking together the rough cuts as the scenes were being shot, and Final Cut Pro gave them the flexibility that they needed to edit quickly. On this movie most of the action was shot using Sony cameras but there were several scenes on which a RED camera was added when an additional camera was needed. Even though there is a significantly different workflow between the two types of camera, the RED material was able to be integrated smoothly with the Sony footage.</p>

<p>7. No Country for Old Men (2007)</p>
<p>A neo-Western thriller from Coen brothers. They directed, wrote, and edited this production.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing for editor Roderick Jaynes (a pseudonym for Joel and Ethan Coen).</p>
<p>Directing and editing a movie brings the two processes a lot closer together for the Coen brothers. An easy to use product such as Final Cut Pro ensures that they can construct the movie’s narrative using the timeline features of the product. This movie marked a chance in approach for the Coen brothers, who took advantage of the better resolution DVCPRO HD for their cutting process compared to earlier films that were cut at DV resolution.</p>

<p>8. 300 (2007)</p>
<p>Based on a graphic novel by Frank Miller, this is the fictionalized retelling of the Battle Termopylae - part of the Persian Wars. Directed by Zack Snyder, the movie was filmed with a super-imposition chroma key technique to help replicate the imagery of the original comic book. Editing on the movie was by William Hoy.</p>
<p>To capture the graphic novel look and feel of the film’s images, editor Hoy used a number of the key Final Cut Pro features such as the adjustment layer and blending modes to create depth and mood. With the look and feel of this movie so dependent on the effects created, editor Hoy spent a lot of time debating what was being added visually to each shot and how this would impact the length and continuity of each scene.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p>9. Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow (2004)</p>
<p>With big name stars (Gwyneth Paltrow and Jude Law), this was an unusual film that used digital artists to build multi-layered 2D and 3D backgrounds for live action footage, with hand-drawn storyboards recreated as computer-generated 3D animatics. Critically it was well received but didn’t set the box office alight.</p>
<p>Editing on the movie was by Sabrina Plisco.</p>
<p>Final Cut Pro was particularly critical to create a scene between two characters that was shot in a physical set (unlike the digital soundstage that was used for the rest of the movie). Final Cut Pro allowed the filmmakers to line up the animatics with the live onstage footage. One of the challenges with this movie is that the editors had to manually assign time-codes to each take - the clips were then rendered out and sorted so that they could be used on a Final Cut Pro SD workstation. This approach was also used to create the master off-line cut. Batch lists of the cuts were then imported into Final Cut Pro.</p>

<p>10. Cold Mountain (2003)</p>
<p>This is an epic Civil War drama based on the novel by Charles Frazier. Starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger this was critically acclaimed and performed reasonably well at the box office.</p>
<p>The movie was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Editing let by editor Walter Murch.</p>
<p>This was really seen as the breakthrough movie for the use of Final Cut Pro in Hollywood Movies. An entire book has been produced analysing how editor Murch used Final Cut Pro to edit the movie and analysis its impact on future cinema productions. Editor Murch believes that the use of Final Cut Pro on this movie indirected affected the ultimate creative outcome. In particular, the use of the DVD authoring capabilities on Final Cut Pro meant that the editing team was able to look at the material more often, sharing it with more people, and changing the way that they looked at certain scenes.</p>
<hr>
<p>While Hollywood movies require editing tools of the highest order, the range of effects that you can achieve using Final Cut Pro is impressive - as well as the standard ripple, roll, slip, slide, scrub, razor blade and time remapping edit functions, Final Cut Pro also comes with a range of video transitions and a range of video and audio filters that will take your film project to the next level.</p>
<p>It is clear that Final Cut Pro is definitely now a star in the editing of Hollywood movies, it is time to make it a star in editing your movies as well.</p>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.tiktok.com/en/" >TikTok <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> is the latest of media sharing applications to cause a worldwide frenzy and gain a huge number of users practically overnight. A big reason for its success is the large number of fun features that allow the users to alter their videos with just a few clicks.</p>
<p>With cool effects and filters, it’s possible to create a wide range of videos that catch the viewer’s attention and put a smile on his face. On the other hand, videos can be created and shared from mobile phones in seconds, enabling its users to show a lot of different situations and express a lot of ideas.</p>
<p>Reversing is also one of the popular options on TikTok and it can be readily performed even without deeper knowledge of video production and editing. Here is how you can do it effectively, either with built-in tools provided by TikTok or with additional pieces of software.</p>

In fact, there is a dedicated function you can use to reverse your video instantly and without leaving the app.</p>
<p>To activate this function, you need to click on the Effects button at the bottom of the screen and then select the Time effects category. The reverse option can be found in this menu, and it will change the direction of the entire clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Reverse video on TikTok"
                ></p>
<p>After you click on Reverse and review your new video, all you need to do is to save the file and it is ready to be shared with the public. The entire process lasts just a few seconds and doesn’t require any technical skills, so anyone can take advantage of this simple effect to create exciting videos that play with the concept of time and resonate with the online audience.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok"><a href="#How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?"></a>How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok only allows video authors to reverse their own videos if they want, but viewers can’t just watch the videos they see online backwards. They are limited to straightforward viewing, although it is possible to jump forward to any part of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Reverse Vid for iOS"
                ></p>
<p>The only solution to this limitation involves external playback tools, so if you really want to watch a certain video in reverse you could try to download it to your phone and use a different video player. For example, iPhone owners can pick up a third-party app like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards/id950551948" >Reverse Vid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the App Store that lets them use reverse playback.

In fact, there is a dedicated function you can use to reverse your video instantly and without leaving the app.</p>
<p>To activate this function, you need to click on the Effects button at the bottom of the screen and then select the Time effects category. The reverse option can be found in this menu, and it will change the direction of the entire clip.</p>

                ></p>
<p>After you click on Reverse and review your new video, all you need to do is to save the file and it is ready to be shared with the public. The entire process lasts just a few seconds and doesn’t require any technical skills, so anyone can take advantage of this simple effect to create exciting videos that play with the concept of time and resonate with the online audience.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok-3"><a href="#How-to-Play-Someone-Else’s-Video-in-Reverse-on-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?"></a>How to Play Someone Else’s Video in Reverse on TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok only allows video authors to reverse their own videos if they want, but viewers can’t just watch the videos they see online backwards. They are limited to straightforward viewing, although it is possible to jump forward to any part of the clip.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Reverse Vid for iOS"
                ></p>
<p>The only solution to this limitation involves external playback tools, so if you really want to watch a certain video in reverse you could try to download it to your phone and use a different video player. For example, iPhone owners can pick up a third-party app like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/reverse-vid-play-it-backwards/id950551948" >Reverse Vid <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from the App Store that lets them use reverse playback. Once the app is installed and the video is stored on the phone, there is nothing preventing the user from watching it backwards on the mobile screen.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Reverse-A-Video-on-CupCut-And-Share-It-on-TikTok-3"><a href="#How-to-Reverse-A-Video-on-CupCut-And-Share-It-on-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?"></a>How to Reverse A Video on CupCut And Share It on TikTok?</h2><p>Users who know a bit more about video editing and want more control over the final product can use external tools instead of TikTok’s own function. There are many video editors for TikTok that could do the trick, but CupCut is one of the simplest apps that will work from your phone and can be downloaded for free.</p>
<p>In CupCut, you can precisely select the part of the video you want to reverse and even adjust playback speed if you want. That gives you more creative freedom and unlocks the possibility to attempt more ambitious visual ideas.</p>
<p>Of course, once you reverse the video in CupCut you will need to export it to TikTok before you can share it with your contacts. Since both of those apps support the same video formats, this process should run very smoothly and without any compatibility issues.</p>

However, more <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >advanced editing software <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> suits give you the option to have both video and audio run backwards in unison. For example, you can use <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmora.wondershare.net/filmora-video-editor.html" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> for this purpose and accomplish the task in several easy steps.</p>
<p>First, you need to set up the project to 9:16 <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >aspect ratio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> since the video will be shared on TikTok. And then you can import the video footage to Filmora.</p>
<p>To reverse the video and audio at the same time, right-click the clip in the timeline and then select <strong>Speed and Duration</strong>. In the Custom Speed window, check the <strong>Reverse Speed</strong> option and click <strong>OK</strong> to save the changes.</p>
<p>Play the clip and you will find the video and audio is reversed at the same time.</p>
<p>If you don’t want to reverse the audio, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >detach the audio from the video <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> first and then reverse the video separately.</p>
<p>When you complete these steps, you are ready to export the video and re-import the reversed clip back into TikTok.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?</h2><p>As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it’s accomplished by using a<strong>picture ratio</strong> <strong>calculator</strong>. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.</p>
<p>You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image’s width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.</p>
<p>The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image’s actual size.</p>
<p>Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.</p>
<p><strong>Types of picture size ratios</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:1 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg"
                      alt="1:1 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>A 1:1 ratio includes an image’s width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>3:2 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg"
                      alt="3:2 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>5:4 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg"
                      alt="5:4 Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.</p>
<p>In the following sections, let’s uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-1920x1080-in-Ratio"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-1920x1080-in-Ratio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?"></a>Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?</h2><p><img

                      alt="1920x1080 in Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-You-Find-the-Ratio-of-an-Image"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-You-Find-the-Ratio-of-an-Image" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?"></a>Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?</h2><p>Before finding the image ratio, understand that there’s a difference between image size and image ratio.</p>
<p>Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you’ll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.</p>
<p>It’s essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You can use this<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this<strong>image size ratio calculator</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-1920x1080-Aspect-Ratio-and-16-9-Aspect-Ratio-Differences"><a href="#Part-4-1920x1080-Aspect-Ratio-and-16-9-Aspect-Ratio-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences"></a>Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences</h2><p>These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-The-Resolution-Calculator-Image-Ratio-Calculator"><a href="#Part-5-The-Resolution-Calculator-Image-Ratio-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)"></a>Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)</h2><p>To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.</p>
<p>Understand the following five variables:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> H1 Height of the initial image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> W1 Width of the initial image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> H2 Height of the final image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> W2 Width of the final image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A percentage - the proportion of the initial image’s ratio to the final image’s ratio.</p>
<p>The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:</p>
<p><strong>H1&#x2F;W1 &#x3D; H2&#x2F;W2,</strong></p>
<p><strong>H1 * A% &#x3D; H2, and</strong></p>
<p><strong>W1 * A% &#x3D; W2</strong></p>
<p>You are not required to understand the details by heart; if the initial resolution is generally used, use the list to select the ideal ratio:</p>
<p><strong>Proportions</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 4:3,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3:2,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 16:9,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 16:10,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 1:1, square, in some social networks,</p>

<p>The most standard aspect ratios of videos are 4:3 and 16:9. Despite these two, 9:16 and 1:1 get famous over social media platforms these days.</p>
<p>As far as you may know, various media players help you to transform the aspect ratio in real-time when playback. Yet this modification is temporary. You are required to change the aspect ratio again next time you open them.</p>
<p>But, changing the aspect ratios is pretty different than other media players. You need to launch the program and create a new project simply. But, before you do a new project, you can easily change it at the beginning panel.</p>
<p>The Filmora assists you in changing the aspect ratio of the project after downloading. Hit the drop-down tab, and you will choose the options among 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, and 21:9 aspect ratios.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?</h2><p>As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it’s accomplished by using a<strong>picture ratio</strong> <strong>calculator</strong>. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.</p>
<p>You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image’s width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.</p>
<p>The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image’s actual size.</p>
<p>Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.</p>
<p><strong>Types of picture size ratios</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:1 Ratio</strong></p>

                ></p>
<p>A 1:1 ratio includes an image’s width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>3:2 Ratio</strong></p>

<p>The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>5:4 Ratio</strong></p>

<p>Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you’ll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.</p>
<p>It’s essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>

<p>The most standard aspect ratios of videos are 4:3 and 16:9. Despite these two, 9:16 and 1:1 get famous over social media platforms these days.</p>
<p>As far as you may know, various media players help you to transform the aspect ratio in real-time when playback. Yet this modification is temporary. You are required to change the aspect ratio again next time you open them.</p>
<p>But, changing the aspect ratios is pretty different than other media players. You need to launch the program and create a new project simply. But, before you do a new project, you can easily change it at the beginning panel.</p>
<p>The Filmora assists you in changing the aspect ratio of the project after downloading. Hit the drop-down tab, and you will choose the options among 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, and 21:9 aspect ratios.</p>

<p>The most standard aspect ratios of videos are 4:3 and 16:9. Despite these two, 9:16 and 1:1 get famous over social media platforms these days.</p>
<p>As far as you may know, various media players help you to transform the aspect ratio in real-time when playback. Yet this modification is temporary. You are required to change the aspect ratio again next time you open them.</p>
<p>But, changing the aspect ratios is pretty different than other media players. You need to launch the program and create a new project simply. But, before you do a new project, you can easily change it at the beginning panel.</p>
<p>The Filmora assists you in changing the aspect ratio of the project after downloading. Hit the drop-down tab, and you will choose the options among 16:9, 4:3, 1:1, 9:16, and 21:9 aspect ratios.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Picture-Size-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?"></a>Part 1 What is Picture Size Ratio?</h2><p>As already mentioned, a picture size ratio refers to calculating or determining the Ratio of an image. And, it’s accomplished by using a<strong>picture ratio</strong> <strong>calculator</strong>. So, for example, the picture size ratio could vary from 1:1, 4:3, 3:2, 16:9, etc.</p>
<p>You can visualize this aspect ratio by allocating an image’s width and height units. For example, a 6×4 inch image has a 3:2 aspect ratio, whereas a 1920×1080 pixel video includes a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>Fact Check:</strong></p>
<p>An aspect ratio does not contain attached units—instead, it shows how large the width compared to the height, meaning that an image measured in centimeters will have the same aspect ratio even if measured in inches.</p>
<p>The relationship between its height and width decides the shape and Ratio instead of the image’s actual size.</p>
<p>Different aspect ratios consist of varying effects on the image you use. For example, an image set in a 1:1 ratio vs. a 5:4 ratio changes the composition and perception of the photo.</p>
<p><strong>Types of picture size ratios</strong></p>
<p><strong>1:1 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-2.jpg"
                      alt="1:1 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>A 1:1 ratio includes an image’s width and height are square and thus equal. Some standard 1:1 ratios are an 8″x8″ photo, a 1080 x 1080 pixel image generally used for mobile screens, print photographs, and social media platforms.</p>
<p><strong>3:2 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-3.jpg"
                      alt="3:2 aspect ratio"
                ></p>
<p>The 3:2 Ratio is generally 35mm film and photography and is still extensively used for prints. Images framed at 6″x4″ or 1080×720 pixels set within this aspect ratio.</p>
<p><strong>5:4 Ratio</strong></p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/how-do-you-find-the-picture-ratio-calculator-4.jpg"
                      alt="5:4 Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>Last but not least, this Ratio is standard in photography and art prints and photography.</p>
<p>In the following sections, let’s uncover more about the photo aspect ratio and its related calculator!</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-is-1920x1080-in-Ratio-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-is-1920x1080-in-Ratio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?"></a>Part 2 What is 1920x1080 in Ratio?</h2><p><img

                      alt="1920x1080 in Ratio"
                ></p>
<p>1920 x 1080 is itself a 16:9 aspect ratio. By default, DSLRs, smartphones, and most modern camcorders record video at 1920 x 1080.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-You-Find-the-Ratio-of-an-Image-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-You-Find-the-Ratio-of-an-Image-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?"></a>Part 3 How Do You Find the Ratio of an Image?</h2><p>Before finding the image ratio, understand that there’s a difference between image size and image ratio.</p>
<p>Unlike aspect ratios, image size shows the actual width and height in pixels. Image size refers to the image dimensions. You can measure its dimensions in any unit, but you’ll generally see pixels used for digital or web images and inches used for print images.</p>
<p>It’s essential to note that two different images containing the same aspect ratio may not have the exact dimensions of an image. For instance, the image has 1920×1080 pixels has 16:9 aspect ratios, and an image sized at 1280×720 pixels has a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<p>You can use this<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://calculateaspectratio.com/" >tool <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>to measure the aspect ratio of images. Here, match either ratio width and ratio and height or pixel width and pixel height to find the aspect ratio in this<strong>image size ratio calculator</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="Part-4-1920x1080-Aspect-Ratio-and-16-9-Aspect-Ratio-Differences-3"><a href="#Part-4-1920x1080-Aspect-Ratio-and-16-9-Aspect-Ratio-Differences-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences"></a>Part 4 1920x1080 Aspect Ratio and 16:9 Aspect Ratio Differences</h2><p>These are almost the same. The only difference is that of the pixels. If you cancel the numbers 1920 and 1080, they will automatically come as 16 and 9. 1920 x 1080 is a 16:9 aspect ratio.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-The-Resolution-Calculator-Image-Ratio-Calculator-3"><a href="#Part-5-The-Resolution-Calculator-Image-Ratio-Calculator-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)"></a>Part 5 The Resolution Calculator (Image Ratio Calculator)</h2><p>To use a picture aspect ratio calculator, you need to understand the following.</p>
<p>Understand the following five variables:</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> H1 Height of the initial image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> W1 Width of the initial image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> H2 Height of the final image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> W2 Width of the final image</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> A percentage - the proportion of the initial image’s ratio to the final image’s ratio.</p>
<p>The aspect ratio formulas that sync the quantities mentioned above for the ratio converter are:</p>
<p><strong>H1&#x2F;W1 &#x3D; H2&#x2F;W2,</strong></p>
<p><strong>H1 * A% &#x3D; H2, and</strong></p>
<p><strong>W1 * A% &#x3D; W2</strong></p>
<p>You are not required to understand the details by heart; if the initial resolution is generally used, use the list to select the ideal ratio:</p>
<p><strong>Proportions</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 4:3,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 3:2,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 16:9,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 16:10,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 1:1, square, in some social networks,</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 85:1,</p>
<p><strong>Pixels</strong></p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 2048:1536, iPad with Retina screen;</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 1920:1080, HD TV, iPhone 6 plus; and</p>
<p><strong>●</strong> 800:600, traditional television &amp; computer monitor standard.</p>
